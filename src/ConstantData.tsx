Here are six key reasons why mindfulness is so crucial for overall wellbeing:</p>\n<ol><li> Decreased stress and anxiety: Mindfulness has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety by helping individuals connect to the present moment and reduce negative self-talk and ruminating thoughts. This can lead to greater feelings of calm and relaxation, positively impacting overall wellbeing.</li><li>Improved emotional regulation: Mindfulness can aid individuals in recognizing, understanding, and regulating their emotions more effectively, leading to increased self-awareness and better coping skills in difficult situations. This can help individuals respond to situations in a more effective and positive way, ultimately leading to an improved sense of wellbeing.</li><li>Increased focus and attention: Mindfulness has been shown to increase focus and attention, leading to improved productivity and overall performance. This can also lead to greater feelings of accomplishment and satisfaction, contributing to overall wellbeing.</li><li>Better relationships: Mindfulness can improve relationships by helping individuals communicate more effectively, cultivate empathy and compassion, and reduce conflict. This can lead to greater feelings of connection and social support, which are essential for overall wellbeing.</li><li>Improved physical health: Mindfulness has also shown numerous benefits, such as lowering blood pressure, reducing inflammation, and boosting the immune system. These physical health benefits can positively impact overall wellbeing.</li><li>Increased self-compassion: Mindfulness can help individuals cultivate self-compassion and reduce self-criticism, leading to greater feelings of self-worth and overall wellbeing.

Although we talk about leaders and leadership, have we ever tried to actually define or understand leadership? What makes a leader? What are the qualities and behaviors that separate them from the rest of the world? This is crucial knowledge for developing future leaders.</p>\n<p><strong>Who is a Leader?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Simply put, this quote explains this concept in a nutshell.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>A Leader is one who Knows the Way; Goes the Way; and Shows the Way </em></strong><strong>….John C. Maxwell</strong></p>\n<p>A leader is someone who works with a vision and motivates people to achieve that vision. He knows how things can be improved in a critical situation. He knows how to make tough decisions and when required, be empathetic to the needs of his people.  Leaders become great not because they have the power but because of their ability to empower others. He empowers his team to do great things.  He creates future leaders. A true leader has the courage to stand by his team, at the same time guide his team towards growth and development.  Leaders are able to bring the team together to work as one entity to achieve any goals set out and make the vision a reality. </p>\n<p>Becoming a Leader is no easy task because of the many facets to this personality. But it is not impossible either. We all are or could become leaders given that we start to think, imbibe and behave in the manner a leader does. Some people have the notion that just being able to motivate people is enough to become a leader.  No, that is just a miniscule part of a leader’s personality. A leader’s personality has many layers, each layer necessary for the value he brings in, the path he creates, the people who he motivates and the vision that he achieves. </p>\n<p>Many businesses and business leaders have recognized the value that NLP brings to a variety of business activities including professional and personal development. What all Leaders have in common is their desire to better understand and support their teams to develop and to help them be the best they can be, more result oriented and focused. How can NLP ((Neuro-Linguistic Programming) help you become a better Leader?</p>\n<p>What is NLP all about?</p>\n<p>Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) is a pseudoscientific approach to communication, personal development, and psychotherapy created by Richard Bandler and John Grinder in California, United States, in the 1970s. NLP’s creators claim there is a connection between neurological processes (neuro-), language (linguistic) and behavioral patterns learned through experience (programming), and that these can be changed to achieve specific goals in life. In today’s business scenario, NLP has been described and vetted as the art and science of personal excellence – the study of what makes the difference between the excellent and the average. ‘Neuro’ relates to how we use our mind, ‘Lingustic’, is the verbal and non-verbal language we use, and ‘Programming’ our patterns of thinking and behavior.</p>\n<p>NLP looks at patterns of behavior and whether they are helpful and bring about the desired results – and if they don’t we can change things to improve success. It is a tool for modeling excellence and being able to reproduce that excellence in ourselves and share it with others.Knowledge of NLP tools and strategies opens up new opportunities for continued leadership development, which is non-negotiable.</p>\n<p>Leaders learn and gain actionable steps that help them address today’s complex leadership challenges and achieve tangible results.  They are able to develop the competencies crucial for success allowing them to create a leadership growth plan to tackle a real work challengesthey could face.</p>\n<p><strong>As a Leader, what could you gain with NLP?</strong></p>\n<p>Often people are unaware of their own hidden leadership development potential and how this potential remains dormant due to their unconscious choices and behavior. A qualified NLP practitioner is able to activate these latent qualities by way of simple modifications in their attitudes, behavior and communication.</p>\n<ul><li>NLPpractitioners canassist leaders get ahead of the line, by using advanced language patterns and physiology techniques to reveal the deeper structure of meaning that influences their beliefs, thoughts and behavior</li><li>NLP help you develop the fundamental skills of leadership; helps you learn to effectively communicate and inspire trust with people</li><li>Help you develop competencies, skills and  insights all of which are crucial for success</li><li>Discover and practice new techniques and strategies for current and future growth opportunities</li><li>Gain an increased sense of self-awareness which will enable to create a leadership growth plan to tackle a real work challenge you could be facing</li><li>Explore and alter negative patterns of behavior, remove limiting behaviorsand radically improve your ability to communicate effectively</li></ul>\n<p>The benefits of NLP leadership training do not end here. The skills you learn will filter into other areas of your life too. These interactive, leadership training programs offer compelling conversations, eye-opening insights, and actionable strategies for addressing the real-world challenges that matter most. The take away from such a program would be:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Practicing Self-restraint                                                             </strong></p>\n<p>A great leader is not reactive. Being calm under pressure is the sign of a great leader and people look up to such a person in moments of crisis for direction. NLP training will guide on how to self-reflect, work past personal emotional triggers, and develop the patience and courage required to work past such situations.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Walk the Talk</strong></p>\n<p>Effective leaders lead by example –for them their vision is not just jargon but followed by action and completion. And they inspire their people to do the same.NLP training gives you the tools to develop an action plan to steer the course in the right direction.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Giving the right motivation and inspiration</strong></p>\n<p>A great leader does not hesitate to commend or motivate his team when required. They lead with a high emotional quotient (EQ).No ego or attitude stops him from supporting his people whenthe need arises. This attitude can be developed with NLP training, wherein you develop a keen self-awareness and empathy to create an environment where your people can grow and thrive.</p>\n<p><strong>4.NLP allows you to think differently</strong></p>\n<p>Great leaders think differently, have different ideologies that enable them to see the world broadly and stay competitive in their business endeavors.  This kind of mindset is what is required to create excellence in today’s corporate climate.</p>\n<p><em>Leadership is not a position or a title; it is action and example</em>….Donald McGannon</p>\n<p>People are often questioning if they have the capabilities in themselves to be a good leader. The crux of the matter is that, we all have the capacity and capabilities to be great leaders.  But action is what matters.  To become a leader is a journey. It’s the courage and conviction to fulfill this journey that separates the doers and who don’t.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

Abhijit Naskar</p>\n<p>Do you want to be the best presenter and trainer you can possibly be?Do you want to earn money while transforming and empowering other people?Whether you’re a Life Coach or a Trainer or working with an organization conducting trainings for employees and senior management, you will want to give value to your participants/clients with the trainings and coaching you provide. </p>\n<p>Many people are frustrated with their current life position and want help to bring in the desired change, to live a better life. Imagine being able to bring about this difference in people’ lives, at the same time you earn handsomely through the process? Very much possible with the help of Neuro-Lingusistic Programming (NLP) interventions.</p>\n<p>What is NLP – Neuro-Lingusistic Programming?</p>\n<p>Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) is a psychological approach that involves analyzing strategies used by successful individuals and applying them to reach a personal goal. It relates thoughts, language, and patterns of behavior learned through experience to specific outcomes. Proponents of NLP assume all human action is positive. Therefore, if a plan fails or the unexpected happens, the experience is neither good nor bad—it simply presents more useful information.</p>\n<p>Neuro-Linguistic programming was developed in the 1970s at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Its primary founders are John Grinder, a linguist, and Richard Bandler, an information scientist and mathematician. Judith DeLozier and Leslie Cameron-Bandler also contributed significantly to the field, as did David Gordon and Robert Dilts.</p>\n<p><strong><u>How NLP can help you to be a Better Trainer?</u></strong></p>\n<p>While it is a fact that people want to bring in desired changes into their lives, but when the process starts their good intentions disappear. They start making excuses; prefer to check out the effect by paying and attending a single session rather than buying the entire package, failing to understand that the purchase would ensure accountability and commitment.  We often see this kind of behavior when a person wants to lose weight, or want to establish an exercise regime, learn a new discipline or get rid of some bad habits. This is very disheartening for the trainer or coach.  More often than not, even if they buy the complete package, they start with gusto but slowly excuses start filtering in and their attendance starts to dip.</p>\n<p>Using NLP techniques you will gather the power to help your clients change theirmindset and approach. NLP staunchly believes progress is achievable and that is the mindset you can cultivate in your clients. The manner in which NLP tools and techniques could help you convince and motivate your clients, thus making you an effective trainer would be:</p>\n<ol type="1"><li><strong>Understanding and changing the Psyche of your Client: </strong>When you talk about change, people mostly think it has something to do with outer change, outer work, surface mindset, etc. hence they come prepared for it. NLP enables you with tools that will help you to make your clients focus on the inner changerequired to make the outer change happen.</li></ol>\n<ul><li><strong>Help Clients get into the right Focus and Mindset:</strong>Getting into the right focus mindset is very important when you invite any kind of change into your life. If you don’t believe in it, you cannot achieve it. When you think you can, you will. This mindset will happen only when all three states are in synergy, particularly the physical, emotional and mental states.</li></ul>\n<p>When all these states are in synergy, your goals become clear and you develop the motivation and resilience to keep going where others give up. You are in the ‘HOW’ and come out of the ‘WHY’ or ‘WILL I’ zones?</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Gain the advantage of Using ‘Linguistics’ tool from NLP</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Language of ‘Linguistics’ forms a large part of any communication. Whether you are talking to someone, motivating or negotiating, training or coaching, the ‘game-changer’ lies in the words you use to convey your message. Using the correct language to get the right point across,to enable a positive response and action. Effectiveness of communication is measured based on the response you get.</p>\n<p>Learning NLP enables you to Masterthe usage of Metaphors in your conversations/trainings to achieve the right results. It also talks of using language patterns to generate curiosity about a concept. These inductive language patterns are called Milton Language Patterns and are also used during Hypnosis. You also have the deductive language patterns which are called Meta Language Patterns. NLP also teaches you to be flexible about the language you could use as per the situation or person. An accomplished trainer uses all these language types mentioned very well, and to his advantage.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>NLP ‘Circle of Excellence’ intervention helps you be in the right ‘state of mind and body’ for training</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Ever watched those trainers who always seem to be energetic, especially in front of an audience? Notice how energetic they are during their motivational talks. They understand and use a lot of NLP to their advantage. NLP helps them manage and be in the right state of mind, all the time.It is the ‘Circle of Excellence’, a very powerful intervention of NLP that does the magic. What is ‘Circle of Excellence’ intervention? It is visualization. You visualize a Circle in front of where you are standing. The moment you step into the Circle, you feel all the positive emotions which you would like to feel before any important event. It works by repeatedly programming yourselfwith relevant questions and affirmations and eliciting a positive state and then stepping into the circle when emotions are at their peak. Doing this time and again programs your brain to feel the same way when you step into the Circle of Excellence before any challenging event. Excellence slowly becomes a part of you.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>NLP teaches you to use Voice and Charisma</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Voice modulation is one or the most important aspects of content/ training delivery.NLP teaches you to use tools like ‘Analog Markers’ and ‘Embedded Commands’ in the vocal dimension of communication. The end benefit would show in the results of the training, which means the suggestions or learning of the training will directly reach the participants through their unconscious minds.Imagine being able to achieve excellence in any field through this method. Mind blowing, isn’t it.</p>\n<p>Another important factor to consider; why should people listen to you or why should they believe you. People will listen and implement only when they know the trainer is credible.  That whatever he says has value and it has been established many times.  Establishing credibility is another aspect every trainer has to achieve and becomes a major part of his personality. NLP helps you achieve this with the intervention of Building Rapport with the Group using Charisma Pattern from NLP.</p>\n<p>Neuro-Linguistic Programming provides a model of change and a variety of tools and techniques to help clients with the “inner game” of growth, by developing a mindset for success. Your clients rely on you to help them get the results they want – to achieve their goals. So how are you going to help them? Simple. Take the help of NLP interventions. Differentiate yourself from all the other Personal Trainers. Increase the likelihood of your clients achieving their goals. Motivate them and help them get into the mindset for success.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

Nothing is<br/>impossible; nothing is beyond reach once a person decides and is stubborn and determined enough to achieve it. The irony is only about 5% of the people in the world have this winning mindset, whereas 95% are still trying or have given up.</p>\n<p>Then the excuses arise! They had better opportunities, I do not have enough time to explore; they were born with a silver spoon; they were lucky whereas I am not and so on. Such words, actions and mindset that could only be termed as limiting and the harbinger of a wasted life when there was so much within to achieve and allow to make the most of opportunities out there.</p>\n<p>We all want success, happiness, money, joy, fame (many of them), and so on.<br/>Sometimes we do not know how to make this happen and many times we are not motivated to even try. The best part is, it is not exceedingly difficult if one decides to do it, which is developing the right mindset to attract success into one’s life. The best tools and techniques to achieve this is set very effectively in NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming), the science of the mind and emotions. </p>\n<p><strong>What is NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming)?</strong></p>\n<p>In short, Neuro-Linguistic Programming is a set of skills that reveal the kind of communication that matters most – on the inside and out. NLP comprises models, techniques and strategies to help us understand this language and use it to influence the way we think and the results we get! NLP helps you achieve whatever you want in life by making you aware and enabling you to reflect on your existing patterns and ways and means through tools and techniques to use your thoughts, behavior and actions in a compelling manner which will get you the results you want in your life. In the end, all it takes is the will to realize your potential.</p>\n<p><strong>Know your Potential</strong></p>\n<p>NLP is a very practical science, dealing with the Physiology and Psychology for Excellence. It directly deals with your mind, the most powerful factor in human enablement. It enables you to have powerful thoughts. If thoughts are powerful, actions become powerful. If actions are powerful one experiences the power of success. It is all in the mind! NLP enables you to become more effective in your thinking and action by gaining full control of your mind with the help of a set of techniques you can practice to gain the benefits of NLP and change anything you want and derive extraordinary results.</p>\n<p>Research has shown us that most people use only a small fraction of mind power and the rest is dormant. We all have more or less the same mind and unfortunately, we have collected so many limiting beliefs about ourselves, with people in our environment telling us what we are good at and what we are not, so much that, there is a lot of chaos and clutter in most of us, that a huge clean up should be the first thing on the agenda.</p>\n<p><strong>What can NLP do?</strong></p>\n<ul><li>De-clutter your mind, eradicating limiting beliefs and forced chaos</li><li>Plant enabling behaviors and instill a positive outlook towards life. Beliefs of excellence that will change the way you experience and interact with those around you</li><li>Introduce you to the power of communication in influencing the thoughts and actions of self and others</li><li>Help you deal with distractions that obstruct performance and build consistent focus</li><li>Through modeling, one of the strongest tools used in NLP, model successful behaviors and mental processes to achieve outstanding results, replicate success methods of successful people</li><li>Manage your hot buttons – understanding, managing and controlling your emotional responses to manage yourself better in situations</li><li>Discover techniques to self-empower, set and achieve compelling goals to enable desired outcomes</li></ul>\n<p>Change is not always easy, especially when you are carrying a behavior which has been with you for years. What works in such instances, is the non-negotiable will to want the change in your life. The best way to start this change is to have a dream, so close to your heart, so desirable that it excites the mind, and to achieve it would bring tears to your eyes. The mind needs this edification, to experience and enjoy the effects of the change as if it’s already happened, in order to create a want, a purpose or a reason to change, and then make that change happen.</p>\n<p>What the mind imagines, start appearing real. We do it unconsciously all the time, NLP urges you to do it consciously. For example, when you start imaging you are a successful businessman, attending important meetings, travelling across the world, making huge profits, the mind gets excited and acts to make that dream is possible. When we become eager and excited seeing the results in our mind, we actively start to act, and we know exactly how to do it and what to do.</p>\n<p><strong>In Conclusion:</strong></p>\n<p>NLP bridges the gap between the things you want and the disconnect you are experiencing right now because your limiting beliefs and behaviors are restricting it from happening. It pushes you out of your comfort zone to find something essentially limitless in potential. It is time to change because it is only the stories that we and other people have told us about ourselves that prevent us from realizing our true potential. Break the shackles, it will set you free. This is your life, make it powerful.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

One of the best tools to help you in this journey of excellence is Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), learning and strategies which willnot only enhance your business environment,but will help you sustain the changes effectively.  <strong><u></u></strong></p>\n<p>NLP is being used by many leading companies to bring in the desired change as part of their training and capability building initiatives, and is testament to the efficacy of the techniques and approach used with participants.</p>\n<p>What is NLP? Is it a science, a tool or a strategy?  It is all Three.  A science because it deals with the power of the conscious and sub-conscious mind. Tools and Strategies are the means and methods with which the science is applied and results achieved.</p>\n<p>NLP which is called Neuro-Linguistic Programming is a mind tool and that’s exactly what it does. Through the use of language and body language it enables practitioners to change thoughts and feelings of themselves and those around them in a predictable way. It allows for more effective communication of a message by enabling people to shift to receptive and enabling emotional states, as well as getting the essence of the message across.</p>\n<p>NLP can also be defined as a modeling approach that offers a toolkit of approaches for dealing with life’s opportunities and challenges. It is a very practical discipline, concerned with bringing results into the real world.</p>\n<p><strong><u>How can NLP Help in Business?</u></strong></p>\n<p>An NLP Practitioner is able to study what an individual is doing at both the conscious and the unconscious levels, it can help replace unhelpful/limiting or destructivebehaviors with another more useful or constructive behaviors. The areas in business it could help majorly are:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Internal Communications</strong></li></ul>\n<p>The importance of developing Interpersonal Skills and Emotional Intelligence has been seen by many top companies worldwide. NLP approaches have been known to reprogramcommunication and sensitivity related concerns at a DNA level. NLP tools allow one to develop the right habits and thinking, use powerful language patterns to empower and make the most of the non-verbal sides of communication, use power words to get the desired response, replicate successful habits to derive successful outcomes. </p>\n<ul><li><strong>Build Leadership Skills</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Developing successful habits to be a better performer, a better leader goes hand in hand with knowing how to run a successful empire. If leadership is about vision, management is about planning how to achieve that vision – It’s about doing what needs to be done effectively, efficiently and with a degree of certainty.  Two of the most important aspects for any business to run successfully are, right communication and right attitude. NLP gives you the skills to communicate and give feedback effectively, thus enabling your team to move forward.</p>\n<p>NLP prepares you to be a Leader, set compelling objectives that will energize yourself and others. The tools and strategies of NLP allows you to present your viewpoint elegantly, with self-confidence using language skills that engage and motivate your employees, build good rapport with customers, colleagues and staff, understand people’s capabilities and thus improve your ability to delegate, diagnose organizational problems and decide successful interventions.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Build Presentation Skills</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Presentation isn’t just about being confident. There are a whole lot of skills that go into making or giving an effective presentation. Presentation involves, but is not limited to, language skills, content, body language, the right attitude, confidence, posture, voice tonal quality and courageto deliver and build a connect and make your presentation memorable with your audience.</p>\n<p>NLP can get you past fears with zero pain, and maximum fun. It takes out the fear of public speaking, reduces stress levels and enables a power packed performance. NLP can empower you with the right habits and attitude required to influence from the platform and create dramatic change in the lives of your listeners.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Confidence and Self-Esteem</strong></li></ul>\n<p>“I need more self-confidence” or “I am not as confident as I used to be”, are some of the feelings many people express. Confidence is a state of mind that is dependent on the context, and everybody knows how to be confident. Putting yourself down by saying that you are not confident simply doesn’t serve the purpose. NLP techniques will lead to enabling greater confidence and self-esteem, by removing limiting beliefs you have about yourself and your capabilities.</p>\n<p>NLP can help you:</p>\n<ul><li>Overcome low confidence, destructive thought patterns and poor self esteem</li><li>Hone your senses to develop the necessary intuition, thus increasing your self-awareness</li><li>Modify the way in which you think, feel, and behave to achieve your primary life goals</li><li>Remove old habits and limiting behaviors, and replace them with new ways of thinking and behaving</li><li>Effectively gain more control over how you think, feel and behave</li><li>Apply your new found confidence in all areas of your life in a personal or a professional context</li></ul>\n<p><strong>In conclusion:</strong></p>\n<p>Communication and Presentation skills are critical for any business.  Also, having the right team and team leaders go a long way in ensuring the company remains profitable. It thus makes sense to use any tool or application that can help bring about a radical change in the way we articulate our views and ideas, remain calm and focused in challenging situations and maximize our presence and capabilitiesin business negotiations. </p>\n<p>All these can be achieved by just changing our limiting beliefs about ourselves and situations and replace them with enablers.  This is exactly what NLP does.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

Are these behaviors slowly killing ourtrue potential?</p>\n<p>What is addictive behavior?</p>\n<p>An addictive behavior is a behavior, or a stimulus related to a behavior, that is both rewarding and reinforcing, and is associated with the development of an addiction. Addictions involving addictive behaviors are normally referred to as behavioral addictions.In addiction, dopamine, a brain chemical, is released in the brain’s reward system giving the person a high and is a motive for continuation of the behavior.  It is also termed as positive reinforcement.</p>\n<p>Our behaviorsmirror our subconscious perception of ourselves and the world around us.  Many of these behaviors are formed at a very young age and have come from what our life, our surroundings, people in our lives and some beliefs others and self, have created.  Many times, a result of some false internal belief system.Just imagine, if how we are behaving is not the right way and we bring in a new and positive behavior, would there be a positive lasting change? How would our life be then?</p>\n<p>Your behaviors are more powerful than you realize. When you have the rightbehaviorand attitude towards life, you can literally change your biochemistry. It is only when you believe;you open yourself up to every possibility of change.</p>\n<p><strong>Stages of behavior change</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pre-contemplation – </strong>the time when you are unaware of the problem.</p>\n<p><strong>Contemplation – </strong>you become aware of the problem and desire a behavior change.</p>\n<p><strong>Preparation –</strong> intention of action</p>\n<p><strong>Action – </strong>Practices the desired new behavior</p>\n<p><strong>Maintenance (Sustenance) – </strong>Works to sustain the behavior change</p>\n<p>NLP aids the above process of change by not just creating awareness but provides the necessary  tools, helps you know what is trapping you; provide strategies and technicalities to help the process of changing the values and beliefs to support the new belief; persuade, motivate and facilitate action; and help you sustain your new behavior.</p>\n<p>Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) is a psychological therapy which changes an individual’s thoughts and behaviors in order to help achieve desired outcomes or reach personal goals. It works by relating thoughts, language, and patterns of behavior learned over time and through experience to specific outcomes.  NLP Therapy starts with the presumption that all human actions are positive. NLP works through the conscious use of language and communication to bring about changes in a client’s thoughts and behaviors.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s imagine you are a guy wants to quit the habit of being caustic, always criticizing people, insulting and hurting them. You say to yourself, it’s such a bad habit. I rub so many people the wrong way, they get hurt with my caustic words – I need to stop. But wait, isn’t being honest supposed to be right? Why is being honest wrong? But then people are getting angry. Let me take it slowly. I will wait and see.</p>\n<p>What happened here? In just a matter of seconds, your thoughts went from wanting to change to reasoning why you didn’t have to change and then wanting to wait and revisit the decision.Procrastination.  You know your behavior is wrong but since the behavior has become a part of you, your comfort zone, you don’t want to let go of it very easily. Although a part of you want to change, a part of you tells you why it is not a good idea.</p>\n<p>To bring about this change, you require the help of NLP tools, which will help get you a perspective and stop procrastination, which is yourbrain’s first reaction to the change. For the brain, any change represents danger and it tries to protect us from this danger.  NLP tools and techniques will rewire the brain with positive outcomes to the desired change thus slowly allowing the brain to accept thispositive potential.</p>\n<p>If you really want a change in your behavior and close the gap between where you are and where you want to be, we bring to you, few effective NLP tips you can try today.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Visualization</strong></p>\n<p>Getting to the point, visualization helps you see the result of your hard work and goal before it actually happens. Did you know that your brain can’t tell the difference between something imaginary and something real? In other words, if your imagination is vivid enough, you can trick your brain into experiencing the positive emotions that go along with a positive memory or mental image.</p>\n<p>In this case, you can visualize speaking politely or giving feedback in a manner which leaves the person benefitted.  Like using a commend recommend commend technique. Visualize people feeling benefitted with your feedback. When you visualize this scenario in your mind eye, it motivates you further to achieve it.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Anchoring</strong></p>\n<p>One of the most powerful techniques in NLP which involves connecting a behavioror emotion you want to change to a specific gesture. This trains your brain to associate the positive feeling with the said phrase or gesture.</p>\n<p>Example – First think about the behavior you want to change. Next, replace it with the changed behavior you want to bring into existence. Make this mental image as vivid as possible. Then choose an anchoring action or images.  The actions could be in the form of pressing your right hand thumb onto the palm of your left hand OR pressing both the thumb and index finger of any hand.  You could also anchor with the use of pleasant images of scenery or birds, etc.</p>\n<p>Then, choose an anchoring phrase such as “I will speak positively” or “I will give positive feedback”.  After saying the phrase in your mind, perform the above action.  The new behavior gets anchored.  Repeat this for few days till this becomes the new habit.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Practice Positive Affirmations</strong></p>\n<p>Practicing daily affirmations is an effective habit because it helps, to a large extent, bring optimism into one’s life. Repeating positive affirmations everyday makes one happy and confident.  It increases awareness of possibilities and makes one feel nothing is impossible. Saying the affirmation in the present tense is important because your subconscious mind will work to turn the positive intention into reality; hence, rewiring your brain faster.</p>\n<p><strong>To conclude:</strong></p>\n<p>Practicing these techniques will make you more open to embracing the change. When you start to think, feel, visualize and start the journey of cultivating winning habits and behaviors, you start experiencingthe incredible feelings associated with success.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

Else you will attract what you are not saying, but what your subconscious is telling it to do.</p>\n<p>What is Law of Attraction?</p>\n<p>The Wikipedia definition:</p>\n<p>“The theory of the Law of Attraction is the belief that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts, people can bring positive or negative experiences into their life.”  As simple as that.</p>\n<p>But is it that simple to think or focus on positive and good experiences only? No. Because life keeps throwing challenges and set-backs and a host of various experiences, many of which are not so positive.  But what sets the successful person apart is, he knows how to think, he knows how to react when such situations arise. For those who know the power of positive thoughts and the mindset required, find it very easy to attract success whereas people who are always in worry, or dwell on negative situations, often face such situation leading them to think thatlifeis a journey of failure and pain.</p>\n<p>How can we get into the right mindset, use the right words, create the right understanding to allow Law of Attraction to bring abundance and prosperity into our lives?</p>\n<p>Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) and the Law of Attraction are a potent combination and truly complement each other. This combination has incredible potential since one is the science of the subconscious mind, and the other is the mental strength required to launch you forward and help you achieve your goals.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you program your subconscious mind to use the Law of Attraction?</strong></p>\n<p>NLP is thescience of the mind.  Since it deals with a person’s thoughts and emotions, NLP uses strategies and techniques to help the person understand the situation and help him to form the correct reaction towards any particular  situation so it does not have any adverse effect on the person,nor does it limit him in any way.  In essence, NLP can function as the vehicle and strengthening force behind the Law of Attraction.</p>\n<p>For example, some of us are looking for a promotion or maybe buy a new house. But try as hard as it may, they are not able to get the promotion or face many hurdles in the way of buying a new house.  Many times we wonder why. It is because, without realizing,they are often attracting challenges in life which sometimes appear impossible to meet, that they soon give up and become depressed. This slowly becomes a pattern, and they start feeding their mind with more negative patterns which slowly becomes an unconscious habit.</p>\n<p>We have all faced such situations, haven’t we? What works is that we first become aware that this is not how it should be.  Along with the awareness one must look for the solution too.  You have to make the Law of Attraction work FOR you instead of against you.  NLP guides us how we should take charge of our lives and welcome abundance into our lives.</p>\n<p>Abundance does not mean money alone.  Abundance flows into various areas of our lives. There are six Universal Laws of Abundance and the Law of Attraction is one among them.</p>\n<p>The six Universal Laws of Abundance are:</p>\n<ul><li>The Law of Subconscious Influence</li><li>The Law of Attraction</li><li>The Law of Creation</li><li>The Law of Polarity</li><li>The Law of Balance</li><li>The Law of Flow</li></ul>\n<p>We will particularly study the Law of Attraction here.  Mind is a powerful tool.  What we think, we become. Hence we should focus on what we want and not attract what we don’t want.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Law of Attraction</u></strong></p>\n<p>Wiki definition: In the New Thought philosophy, the Law of Attraction is the belief that positive or negative thoughts bring positive or negative experiences into a person’s life. The belief is based on the ideas that people and their thoughts are made from “pure energy”, and that a process of <strong>like</strong> energy attracting <strong>like</strong> energy exists through which a person can improve their health, wealth, and personal relationships. One of the strong beliefs in NLP aiding the Law of Attraction is, you manifest what you want to be.</p>\n<p>Since you manifest through thoughts of your conscious, subconscious mind and visualization, some of the manifestations can be positive whereas some can be negative.  Even if you want to manifest positive outcomes, there are limiting beliefs that will not allow you to do so, thus leading to disillusionment. </p>\n<p><strong>How can NLP help?</strong></p>\n<p>Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) can help you remove these limiting beliefs and steer your thinking towards positive outcomes.But to get to the root of the limiting belief, you must first introspect and answer few questions such as:</p>\n<ul><li>What is the belief that is holding me back?</li><li>What had happened for me to believe that?</li><li>Why am I afraid it would happen again?</li><li>Do I really believe that it will happen again?</li><li>Who put these beliefs in me?</li><li>What is the trigger? (For repetition of the event)</li><li>How can I change the script? What can I choose to believe instead that is positive and will serve me?</li></ul>\n<p>These are strong and effective introspective questions that can carry you from the plane of self-doubt to the plane of positive outcomes. From the ‘NO’ zone to the ‘YES’ zone.  From self-doubt to ‘I AM POWERFUL’.</p>\n<p>A Powerful Technique, isn’t it?</p>\n<p>But it must be what you really want, else the visualization and manifestation gets diluted since the want, the need is not coming from your core. If you really want it, you can easily imagine it in your mind, visualize and manifest it, and experience it in reality.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

One of the main reasons– it inspires, influences and transforms. There are many benefits to public speaking whether you’re an individual or a business, in education, and in the public arena.The goal of speaking in public, many times, is to influence, educate, entertain, or inspire listeners. Very often, the speaker uses tools like audio-visual aids to enhance the speech and make it more interesting to listeners.</p>\n<p>But is public speaking as easy to learn or do? How many of us are comfortable speaking in public, in front of an audience?  I doubt if many would raise their hands.  As studies have it, public speaking is considered to be the biggest fear a person has, even worse than the fear of death. Everyone is nervous about public speaking, whether be it a seasoned public speaker or a novice, everyone experience butterflies in their stomach before and while facing and speaking in front of an audience.</p>\n<p>It is important to understand that, public speaking skill, if mastered, will add tremendous value both in the personal and professional space.  Imagine being able to keep your audienceengaged for hours. Imagine the kind of influence you could have on them; they would love your talks and hang onto your every word.  Imagine the kind of name and fame such visibility would bring for you.</p>\n<p>Public speaking,as the name suggests, is done before a live audience.  The audience could vary from speech to speech. It is therefore important to have the right attitude, knowledge, confidence and posture when presenting and speaking to a large audience.  There are many factors the speaker needs to take into consideration so that the speech goes off well and the audience gets what they came for.  It is because of this that many times people get nervous with fear that they might blunder or might not deliver as required.</p>\n<p><strong>How can one be a Powerful Speaker?</strong></p>\n<p>Public Speaking is an art one must cultivate.  It doesn’t happen overnight.  One of the best ways to learn is, by using tried and tested NLP techniques.</p>\n<p>With NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming), you will learn some powerful transformational skills you will not learn anywhere else. The techniques used in NLP enable you to get rid of your fear, and equip you with the ability and mastery to deliver speeches spontaneously and effectively. It will help you take control of your emotions and quickly turn fear into power.NLP tools will help you think on your feet and build an almost hypnotic rapport with your audience and keep them engaged. This engagement will help you generate emotional breakthroughs in your audience through subliminal language.</p>\n<p><strong>What is NLP?</strong></p>\n<p>Developed in the early 1970s, NLP uses behavioral and communication techniques to make it easier for people to change their thoughts and actions. NLP explores the links between the way physiology and the brain work, how we use words and accepted patterns of behavior.</p>\n<p>Where enhancing speech and communication is concerned, NLP uses a set of tools, models and techniques that will help us understand ourselves, people and their behavior,  which in turn helps us prepare,have the right mindset and be more successful in whatever we do. In this case, it can help take your speech to the next level.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Two methods NLP follows to enhance communication and presentation skills</u></strong></p>\n<ul><li>OVERCOMING FEAR</li></ul>\n<p>Fear, more often than not, is instilled in us from childhood through our upbringing, parents, schooling, friends, and experiences. This ‘programming’ is so strong and includes everything we perceive through our senses. This fear is deeply ingrained in our systems. So, how do we remove it? How do we overcome our fears? NLP does it by listing down the fears, recognizingthem,understanding the triggers that enable fear and then breaking the pattern effectively. It is a process whereby, one can learn and practise these skills thus gaining confidence in turn.</p>\n<p>Fear is not always bad.  It is many times, a good motivator and can often enable us to take actions that are necessary. But, we have to ensure we are aware of this and are not controlled by fear. If we allow fear to control us, it slowly becomes an addiction. NLP teaches us to be aware of our fears, face it and move on.  To be in the here and now is crucial. The process also allows us to recognize the triggers, the patterns that invoke fear in us and use techniques to break this pattern, especially by changing your mindset, to acknowledge fear and change your reaction to it.  This is so powerful that it ultimately changes the way you live your life.</p>\n<ul><li>MODELING SUCCESS</li></ul>\n<p>If you want success, do what other successful people do.  In NLP, this refers to modeling behavior. This process is very powerful as success behaviors are not just modeled on the outside, what someone does in the inside is more important. Modeling the mindset of successful people is what leads to results. Apart from being able to see and hear what and how someone does on the outside, you can infer what they are doing internally. Through NLP techniques, we can get the whole picture of what successful people do well, externally and internally.</p>\n<p>How does it work? We all have seen people talk and present on stage and we have been in awe of them.  How do they do it in such a powerful manner that they are able to hold their audience attention, make them laugh, motivate them, maintaining eye contact throughout, using the correct posture and body language to get their message across, moving with purpose, speaking in a strong clear voice, bringing emotions whenever required. Oh wow. With NLP, we can get to understand what the speaker is doing internally or how he has prepared himself to achievethis success.  It is a process called visualization. Before going to the actual venue, the speaker goes through the motions of what all he would cover, visualizeshimselfgiving a great speech, marks where he will stand on stage at intervals and rehearses what key pointshe will cover when he is at a certain place, maintain eye contact and so on. He has already visualized the process and outcome, hence when he actually delivers, he is at his best, completely prepared.</p>\n<p><strong>In conclusion:</strong><strong></strong></p>\n<p>If you can speak, you can influence.  If you can influence, you can change lives. It is always be good to be prepared, understand the techniques and process and get help with powerful tools like NLP before you go on stage and give a super powerful presentation. Public speaking plays a major role in education, business and government sectors. We all know the power that words have.  Words are used to inform, persuade, educate, and even entertain.  It becomes even more powerful in the hands of the right speaker, hence one must ensure that they are used wisely and in a way that would only add value to anyone who listens to them.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

The nature of response to a particular situation needn’t be the same for everyone. It differs from person to person, depending on their closeness, seriousness, personality type, outlook, mental strength, and so on to the situation/person/event. When we emote, it is just like any other behavior. You either have it or you don’t.</p>\n<p>There is no negative or positive emotion. Emotions to a particular situation can wary from person to person. What could be a very emotional experience for one could sometimes not even connect with another. To cut it short, how we emote depends on our personality type, genetics, past exposure to a similar situation, and many other reasons.   It also depends on the phase of life you are in at that moment. Emotions are fixations of energy applied to various situations. Now it is up to us to choose how we use this energy.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Why do we get emotional</u></strong></p>\n<p>Living beings, especially humans and animals – I don’t about aquatic animals or plants and insects – have emotions. Emotions are normal, and many a time, find its way out in the form of an outburst or a crying which later makes the person calm. Heightened emotions could be due to the fact that either you are very sensitive or it can come down to diet choices, genetics, stress or maybe due to some underlying health conditions, such as depression, anxiety or hormonal imbalance.</p>\n<p>There are various reasons, big and small. Some common reasons are:</p>\n<p>1. We are human beings, so emotions are a part of our default packaging.</p>\n<p>2. Emotions are also influenced by genetics. An emotional mother, may have emotional kids. It is also possible a family member could suffer from major depression.  In this case, you may have a higher risk of experiencing one as well.</p>\n<p>3.Amnesia or bad sleep patterns. Lack of sleep can in time, affect our whole functioning, let alone our emotional well-being. We can face all sorts of trouble in thinking, concentrating and performing, which can make us feel inefficient.</p>\n<p>4.  If we are prone to sickness due to weak immunity or suffer from stress and anxiety.</p>\n<p>5. If we have experienced some tragedy and have not been effectively counseled.</p>\n<p>6.  Being too emotional can also be influenced by the foods we eat. An unhealthy diet increases levels of mood swings.</p>\n<p>7.  An unhealthy lifestyle with no exercise or any kind of physical activity can deter emotional well-being.</p>\n<p>8.It’s just the way you are. Some people are, at different phases in their life, very sensitive.</p>\n<p>9.  Hormonal imbalance is another cause for heightened emotions. Especially if you are fighting with Thyroid issues, Menopause, PMS, PCOS, Stress or even when you are pregnant or taking some form of birth control.</p>\n<p>10.  Major upheavals. An emotional person can become highly sensitive when they have to or are going through some major change in life like shifting from one place to another, changing schools, college, getting married, changing jobs, getting retired and so on.</p>\n<p><strong><u>The flipside of being too emotional</u></strong></p>\n<p>Emotions are an integral part of us and the lives around us. Being too emotional brings with it de-motivating emotions like fear, sadness, anger and helplessness. When a person starts experiencing these and it continues for a long time, life becomes a struggle and the person is at a loss of knowing how to deal with the situation effectively. Trying to fix the issue that led to the emotional high can sometimes wreck it and could lead to the situation becoming worse.</p>\n<p>Many times people deal with such situations in the following ways:</p>\n<ol type="1"><li><strong> Pretending it doesn’t exist – Self-Denial – </strong>by refusing to accept or coming to terms with the situation, that they require help.  This leads to bottled-up emotions that build up over a period of time leading to actions that could only cause undeniable harm.</li></ol>\n<ul><li><strong>They hit out at others – I am not OK, you are OK. </strong>People who are too emotional, sometimes develop this mind-set which makes them cause harm to others in order to feel good about themselves. This slowly develops into a habit that is harmful and self-destructive.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>They withdraw into their shell. </strong>When a tortoise or snail senses danger, they withdraw into their shell thinking they are protected.  People who are highly emotional, many times, do the same, so that they won’t have to interact much with other people.But they fail to understand that withdrawal will only bring in extreme loneliness, anger, disconnect and distorted thinking. To be healthy and alive, we need to interact with other people.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Self-Harm.  </strong>One of the dangerousnegative trait of highly emotional people are, they cause self-harm in the form of cutting themselves, not taking care of self, starving or over-eating or forming destructive habits like substance use.  They do this with the intent of either escaping from reality or teaching their close ones a lesson. These behaviors give them temporary relief and make them feel in control of their lives, which in the long run only leads to more isolation, self-doubt and misery.  In the long run, such behavior can even lead to depression and suicides.</li></ul>\n<p><strong><u>Emotional Mastery with NLP</u></strong></p>\n<p>Our thoughts, actions, emotions, behaviors have a lot to do with what is in our minds.  The most efficient science or tool that understands our mind like no other is Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP). NLP tools and strategies if practiced diligently in our day to day lives, help us be in charge of our emotions and bring us to a realization that we can overcome self-inflicted barriers and deal with our negative emotions in healthy ways and come out as capable and efficient human beings.</p>\n<p><strong>How does NLP do it? Some of the methods are given below to get a better understanding.</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Since emotions are at play here, NLP has ways and active strategies that help one develop more emotional flexibility. Increasing emotional flexibility goes a long way to help you master your emotions. Creating settings that allows one to experience a broader range of emotions is a strategy used in NLP where you are exposed to different situations which invoke different emotions like joy, sorrow, anger.  Doing these types of exercises allow you to experience more positive and varied emotions and you don’t get pinned down to negative emotions.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Raising your baseline emotions – Every person more often than not, operates from a baseline of emotions.It could be either one or more. NLP helps you raise your emotional baseline, more in the positive emotions direction, which allow you to have better experiences and changes your outlook towards life. This exercise help you experience fewer emotional impacts when anything negative occurs.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Exposure – People who are highly emotional, mostly thrive on negative emotions. When such behavior surfaces, they are not able to take logical decisions and do not welcome anyone giving any kind of advice. NLP can cause a shift in this pattern of thinking. NLP believes that even if situations, people or events make you feel bad or emotional in a negative manner, it is just as easy to bring yourself out of that emotional situation, motivate yourself and feels good instead. </li></ul>\n<ul><li>Meet challenges head on – Challenges are part of everyone’s lives. We all have to deal with it time and again. NLP works around this theory and brings about a mindset that prepares you to consciously meet these challenges without breaking up. It teaches you to expect to encounter problems, and how to appropriately handle them. It helps you change your perception about a particular challenge with the help of introducing the challenge to your senses – auditory, kinesthetic visual. You experience the challenge with all your senses, which breaks down the challenge in a way that helps you handle each part objectively.</li></ul>\n<p><strong><u>To conclude</u></strong></p>\n<p>NLP’s goal isto help you break your pattern of heightened emotions that is destructive in nature. This is done with the help of strategies and tools designed to help you know what the emotion is, expose you to a variety of other emotions so that the concentration on a particular emotion is diluted, and deal with situations causing negative emotions in a manner that will only add a positive pattern to your life.</p>\n<p>The process is not difficult but requires consistent effort and a will to have a better quality of life.  With expert guidance from an NLP expert, this is not only doable but will change you into a person with limitless potential.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

The difficulty here is (this applies to human beings), to move thorough these changes, with ease and fluidity so that we are able to internalize them and get better with each change.</p>\n<p>If one wants to survive and live a great life, one has to be open and flexible enough to accept the challenges that come with change. How do we do that? Start adapting to the change immediately. Do it in style. No excuses. Which process can help you have this mindset? What better than NLP (Neuro-Lingustic Programming). This amazing technique and science not only opens up doors of your subconscious mind by equipping you with a vast and versatile set of skills,tohelp you move through the change, with greater awareness, ease and fluidity.</p>\n<p>NLP, this science  is not only interesting in its approach of understanding how our mind works in the background, but also how we can become more aware and sensitive toothers subconscious thinking processes and gain a greater understand how and why others think, act and behave,the way they do. When we gain this knowledge, we can understand change, people and human excellence to the greatest degree possible leading us to understand a lot more about our mind and how it works and what it can make possible.  Not only this, NLP techniques help us to understand other people’s minds too.  This knowledge can help us to understand others better, be great negotiators, help in decision making and bring others to our way of thinking which will aid in helping others adapt to changing situations.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Yesterday I was Clever, so I wanted to change the world.  Today I am Wise, so I am changing myself.”…..Rumi</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><u>Can Change be overlooked?</u></strong></p>\n<p>No.  Change is definite.  It will happen whether we want it or not.  Whether we are prepared or not.  Whether we try to overlook it or not.  It will happen. Change could come in many ways, sizes, shapes, situations, people and so on. You could get fired without even a day’s notice, a competitor could just walk away with your project, you might win a bumper lottery, some personal loss.  Many of these changes turn our lives upside down and we are left standing there, with our mouths open, not knowing what to do. Then we look for solutions. And believe me it’s there, very strong, very powerful, and it’s NLP.</p>\n<p>NLP teaches ushow weshould choose to look at and deal with change, in a manner that would only be progressive. It also changes our beliefs, steering it towards welcoming change and start our journey towards a successful and fulfilling life.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Few tools NLP uses to factor change into our lives </u></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong><u>Presuppositions</u></strong></li></ul>\n<p>NLP have a set of ground rules known as NLP presuppositions that form the base for the technology to get the real outcome from NLP. These presuppositions are beliefs of excellence collected from successful people from all walks of life through the NLP technique called as modeling. Whatever beliefs and habits have given positive results to successful people can be patterned and reproduced. One of the beliefs of excellence are that successful people are open to change, allow it into their lives and move forward.</p>\n<p>Neuro-linguistic programming works on how a person thinks, feels, act and behave which allows him to produce results that would either take him to great heights or leave him mediocre.  The change techniques and tools NLP uses is designed for participants to achieve peak performance, overcome fears and phobias, build rapport and unstoppable confidence.With so much going for you, adapting to change would be a piece of cake.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Behavioral Change</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Our Attitude changes our Thoughts to change our Behavior which motivates our Actions and gets us the Results we want.</strong></p>\n<p>Human beings are social animals, always on a look out for what they can gain or achieve. NLP knows our Psychological core. When there is a need, any human being will be adaptive and accepting.  NLP techniques brings out these reactions in an effective manner paving the way for positive intentions and behaviors which will allow a person to adaptwell to change and allow it into their lives. When we see these intentions and behaviors as a positive influence, we are able tolook atthe change as a positive factor rather than something that could cause upheaval.</p>\n<p>Also, if a change occurs, NLP brings another presupposition that we are resourceful.  We have all the resources required to handle any change that occurs.</p>\n<ul><li><strong><u>Mirroring</u></strong></li></ul>\n<p>If one person can do something, anyone can learn to do it</p>\n<p>This is mirroring or positive copy catting. Every person is created with the same amount of abilities and resourcefulness.  Our upbringing, limiting factors, our environment, etc. brings about feelings of inadequacy, fear and resistance.  Mirroring – which forms the foundation of NLP, wherein individuals observe successful people’s habits and behaviors and then mimic them into their lives to gain a similar advantage. This has always been there only different names were given to it like idol worship, succession and so on. Successful individuals for centuries have modeled successful predecessors.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Mind Talk</strong></li></ul>\n<p>The most important and required, non-negotiable trait to welcome and adapt to change is mind talk. When you continuously form a habit of communicating positive intentions through positive and affirmative communication, you live it. Similarly, when the communication is constantly negative, in one form or the other, whether intentional or not, it seeps its way into our mind, enabling limiting behaviors and thoughts. </p>\n<p>NLP teaches us the right kind of communication with our mind (Positive, affirmative communication) that will remove our negative and limiting scripts and replace them with positive and affirmative conversations.</p>\n<p><strong><u>To conclude:</u></strong></p>\n<p>NLP is a brilliant, powerful and humble science that if used in the right manner can change, people, businesses and organizations. By enabling participants and teaching NLP strategies applications, a coach or trainer can help people and organizations, adapt to change in a manner which causes the least stress and allow the change to fit in with ease, with very little challenges</p>\n<p><em>Once Your Mindset Changes, Everything on the Outside will Change with it!….Steve Maraboli</em></p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

Imagine having the power to change your own life first. We all have aspirations.  We all want something out of life.  We all want to be successful, in all spheres of life, be it financial, professional, personal or emotional. But very few of us know how to get there.</p>\n<p>These are the results that a Life Coach can bring forth in a person’s life. As aLife Coach, you will help your client get into the best possible mental state to achieve their goals with the right approach.</p>\n<p>We are aware that the mind is the key any success we achieve in life. To the extent that, if our mind is not ready or prepared, then even having a great strategy won’t help us succeed.  A Life Coach gives us this vision and help us have the right mindset to implement the strategies we design and gain the desired results.</p>\n<p><strong>What Does a Life Coach Do?</strong></p>\n<p>By definition, a life coach encourages and counsels clients on a range of professional and personal issues. Life coaching is distinct from giving advice, consulting, and counseling, mentoring and administering therapy.</p>\n<p>But this is not the limit. Especially if the Life Coach is a certified NLP practitioner and has the required experience and knowledge to his credit.With the help of various NLP tools and strategies, a Life Coach can help identify poor thoughts and behaviors, break negative and limiting patterns, and push to meet and exceed desired results.</p>\n<p>A coach would help their clientsfora specific requirement or an overall perspective. They follow tried and tested means and methods to derive solutions to achieve certain outcomes. They do this by analyzing their clients’ current situation, a SWOT analysis of sorts, to arrive at desired solutions systematically.</p>\n<p><strong>How you can make lives better by becoming a Powerful Life Coach?</strong></p>\n<p>A Life Coach can help clientsin the following Life areas:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Help Clients gain clarity of purpose</strong> – Help clients set clear and focused goals and objectives that will radically change their liveswith short term and long term benefits.  This is mainly done by Identifying, clarifying and creating a vision for what the client wants to achieve</li><li><strong>Encourage client’s self-discovery and growth</strong> – Remove beliefs and blocks that are sabotaging clients from knowing and bringing out their REAL powerful self, which is limitless</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Help clients achieve their health &amp; fitness goals</strong> – A healthy mind and a healthy body, both are required to achieve success. As a coach you are committed to push your clients and make them accountable for staying healthy and start living the life they want.</li><li><strong>Help clients be better professionals, and better leaders</strong>– Foster clients accountability to increase self-productivity. Break limiting behavior and gain required skills to communicate, interact, persuade and inspire others.</li><li><strong>Making an important life transition</strong> – Change is the only constant, but many times it is difficult to start he journey of change. As an experienced Life Coach, you can prepare your client for change, by bringing out their reservoir of acceptance, courage, awareness, passion and confidence</li><li><strong>Help clients grow their business</strong> – By working on relevant behavioral modifications, a Life Coach can help clients step out of their comfort zones and drive sales &amp; profits</li></ul>\n<p>NLP tools and strategies are very effective in Life Coaching.  If we look at it, any traditional process views past as a problem. NLP views it differently. In NLP, the past of a person is used as a framework to understand a person thoroughly in order to construct his future. An experienced Life Coach uses the information as a tool to create the change in their client with the aid of NLP Techniques like Dissociation, Content Reframing, Anchoring, Rapport, Influence and Persuasion.</p>\n<p><strong>To conclude:</strong></p>\n<p>By making some relevant changes, big and small, in their present life, a Life Coach will move them forward, maneuvering their clients with ways and means, with the ultimate aim of realizing positive goals in their personal and professional life. What the client need is, some motivation and encouragement to reach a specific goal, whicha Life Coach provides through relevant material in theform ofstrategy, process, exercises, and overall accountability thus enabling the transformation needed to help clients re-discover themselves and initiate the much required positive change in their lives and live a life which is more balance and fulfilled.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

So, choose yours well.</p>\n<p>Although this blog is mainly about the importance of using power words to enhance success in our careers, our lives, the following story, depicts the stark power that words can have and the outcome that follows,and is a hard-hitting example of ‘word power’. In a certain place in our globe, there is a practice that trees cannot be cut when they are still green.  So what do the people living there do if they want to fell a tree?  A group of people would go near the tree, shout out uncomplimentary, derogatory and toxic words and sentences. They would do this every day till one day the tree dries up and dies.  Then they cut it. Whether be it human, animals, birds, trees or anything living, words can both hurt and inspire. Every single spoken wordhas a huge influence on lives and can even help transform a person’s perspective about themselves, hugely.</p>\n<p>If we go back into memory, during childhood, we remember how when certain words were spoken, for e.g. ‘This painting is so beautiful’; ‘baby, you sang beautifully.  We are so proud of you’; “You solved such a tough math problem.  Wow I am impressed’.  These words spoken, especially by people who have a strong influence in our lives, did it not bring a smile to our faces, make us feel few inches taller? Didn’t it bring in a sense of worth, a feeling of achievement and a wanting to do even better next time.</p>\n<p>What if the words were said in a negative manner – e.g. ‘What have you made? You call that painting? Why do you waste time on such useless things? ; ‘Your voice was raspy? Couldn’t you have practiced some more?  Listen to your friend sing, she does it so well’; “You think that’s a tough math problem?Grow up! Else nobody would even consider you’.  These words spoken, especially by people who have a strong influence over our lives, did it break or finish something in us?</p>\n<p>This doesn’t mean all negative words are bad.  Sometimes, a negative word, said in a certain context, can spur us in the right direction and make us achieve results.  In our growing up years, many times we hear such negative words or criticism which has a strong effect on us.  But the impact does not steer us towards negativity, but spurs us up, to do even better because we know it was well meant.</p>\n<p>It’s a dog eats dog world.  Many people operate with a crab mentality. This behavior is known as survival behavior and sometimes essential. The more likely you are able to bring a person down, the more power you have over him and the more chances for your success.  This is the kind of wrapped mentality people operate with, not knowing that it should be just the opposite.  Hence negative words are more abundant than positive ones. If we want to change this, we begin with ourselves from within ourselves. We start by first changing our vocabulary and mindset. We start by using the power of words to create success for ourselves and for others. The more you give, the more you receive.  Neuro- Linguistic Programming (NLP) has the vocabulary (using power words) tool to help you in this journey in smart and effective communication.</p>\n<p><strong><em>“Simply by changing your habitual vocabulary — the words you consistently use to describe the emotions of your life — you can instantaneously change how you think, how you feel, and how you live.”…..</em></strong> Tony Robbins, American author, public speaker, life coach, and philanthropist.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Re-framing our Vocabulary</u></strong></p>\n<p>Our conversations are so full of metaphors, which we use abundantly in our everyday conversations.  It’s time to consciously make note of what we say or how we use words.</p>\n<p>‘Oh, I am so busy today, I have so much to do, I don’t know if I could even finish’. Just thinking or saying these words can make you feel your shoulders and body become heavier and a huge loss of energy and excitement to even start.  What if we change this to, ‘Wow, another beautiful day. Today maximum tasks on my to do list will be accomplished.  That’s my goal for today.”   This could make you feel more energized, confident and ready to take on challenges and do a good job about it.</p>\n<p>Words like, “It’s too hard for me to do”; “I don’t think I can make it”; “I am not as good as you think I am” will only pull you backwards. If you re-frame the sentences with powerful and positively decisive words, it will move you forward and create something which is transformational.</p>\n<p>NLP uses tools like the Meta Model and the Milton Model which are tried and tested systems and methodscreated to enable a person inspire vision and recreate articulation of experiences to the effect that the person knows exactly how to perceive a certain situation and use the right power words to make that particular situation to work for him.  These systems involve all the three senses – Auditory, Visual and Kinesthetic, since we communicate with the help of all three senses.</p>\n<p><strong>To conclude:</strong></p>\n<p>Our external world is full of thoughts and structures.  What is important is that these thoughts and structures be presented in the right form and manner to get maximum value.  NLP helps individuals create this value through the many tools and strategies adopted so that we human beings get the best value for our efforts.  This also includes our communication efforts.</p>\n<p>Excellence in any form or matter is cultivated over time, with practice, dedication and patience.  Being excellent in the correct way to communicate will not only enhance a person in his or her own entirety, but will also bring value in the lives of every living being they touch, through the power of their words.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

Things can blow out of proportion,if challenges are not handled with care and sensitivity. Teaching is a core human interaction profession and no human being is the same. Each person come with their own upbringing, environment, mind-set, views, challenges, and learning methods.</p>\n<p>With the world getting into a fast competitive mode, the role and functioning of schools and colleges are changing as well.  Teachers are expected to keep up with the changes consequentially;else the well-being of the students and the reputation of the school,areat risk. With so much pressure to perform, the most important concern of schools and teachers are how to increase effectiveness?</p>\n<p>Learning tools, experiments, teaching aids, self-efficacy and technology are doing their best to help ease a teacher’s burden.  But what is more imperative to consistent and quality teaching is that ‘something’which comes from within a person.Learning should feed both the mind and the heart. Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) comes to their rescue, with the necessary mind tools and strategies to not just enhance effectiveness in teaching but also improve their own personality and life in general. Call it a science, a tool or a strategy, NLP has the best, simple and effective methods which can helpteachers become more focused on the “here and now” and increase their effectiveness in training, teaching and coaching.</p>\n<p>Today, having the right kind of education holds the key to a successful career and a bright future. Teachers play a vital role in providing students with the right kind of knowledge which empower students with superior and unique advantages.  For teachers to be able to contribute to a child’s growth and knowledge base, they themselves must first up-skill, not only in the field of their relevant functional knowledge but also learn how to create an environment of effective learning for their students.  To make this happen, teachers must have the skills, tools and strategies, which provide these unique advantages.  What best than the platform of NLP which can help teachers create this environment,so thatlearning becomes a beneficial and exciting interaction.</p>\n<p>NLP strategies and tools have gained worldwide recognition in personal, business, and education sectors and have been improving lives in big and better ways.   It is best known as a self-motivation and personal development tool, but in recent years it has gained traction in the world of education. The use of NLP in the classroom has been a boon to teachers as it brings forth the need to understand that education is not just about reading something from the book and mechanically giving an output in the form of examinations.  Modern education has a very different view. It comes from acknowledging that teachers not only need to have knowledge of the coursework, but also need to be highly skilled at communication and interpersonal interaction.</p>\n<p>Today’s world is also about communicating and interacting in a beneficial manner. NLP lays huge emphasis in creating an environment that is conducive to learning, by relating to others through sensitive and positive interaction. One of the reasons why schools and teachers have welcomed and adopted NLP tools in their teaching methodology.</p>\n<p>To achieve this effectiveness, NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming employs four major approaches, which are:</p>\n<ul><li>Outcomes – strategies for self-motivation and the motivation of others.</li><li>Rapport – approaches for building rapport and influencing others.</li><li>Flexibility – techniques for enhancing flexibility and awareness of others.</li><li>Influential language– language models designed for success, communication skills, power words, voice methods, etc.</li></ul>\n<p>There are many techniques that a good teacher would be using anyway, without even realizing it.  However, a better understanding of NLP tools will enable teachers to use the learning to a greater advantage,thus enabling them to make better decisions and manage their students more effectively. In fact, these techniques are so effective that many universities have adopted these techniques as part of their curriculum.  Even students, today, are being introduced to the benefits of NLP, a sure sign of wider acceptance across the globe.</p>\n<p>A couple of tools used in NLP, especially in the area of education, has communication, interaction, and learning styles as the key components of the tools and strategies used These strategies are similar to the main learning styles put forward which involves multiple intelligences: visual, auditory and kinesthetic, where the learner responds best to demonstrations, charts and other visual stimuli; auditory where a verbal explanation is preferred and kinesthetic where the student learns best from hands-on experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Perceptual Positioning</strong>– Especially aids in removing communication blocks, increase empathy, sensitivity reasoning, understanding and acknowledgement.</p>\n<p>To look at a situation from a different point of view, a different angle than the one they would naturally adopt. This exercise is carried out in the form of role play. For example, the teacher might conduct an exercise involving three students of differing opinions.  They set up three chairs, each of which is tagged with a ‘position’.  They then ask the students to move from one chair to another in order to adopt a different view.</p>\n<p><strong>Outcome:</strong>This technique has been known to have profound effects, since the children are enacting the scene and go through the procedures and communication required for that particular role.  Their active involvement in the scene allows them to get a first-hand experience to see the other person’s point of view or the feeling the other person is going through when a certain activity is carried out. The active involvement and physical and mental interactions could trigger a change in thinking and behavior, much more successfully than a simple request to see someone else’s point of view. This method is very effective when teachers have to tackle bullying and other behavioral issues.</p>\n<p><strong>Presupposition</strong> – Allows students to make choices.  Helps children learn planning and efficient decision making.</p>\n<p>Presupposition deals with a different way of presenting a request. For example a teacher offers the class a choice, “Would you like to write an essay first or complete your notes?  Here the message that both the tasks must be completed is very clear but the choice of which must be done first is given to the class.  This creates a sense of empowerment in the children and they are more likely to give their best in completing both the tasks with very little or no rebellion.Allowing students this element of choice also benefits them in many positive ways further in life and they’re more likely to focus on their decision rather than challenging instructions.</p>\n<p><strong>To conclude:</strong></p>\n<p>Teaching is a noble profession.  A teacher can make or break a student. Hence it is not just a task but a huge responsibility for teachers to enable their students with the right education, not in just the theory aspect but also educate them with regards the way of life. The best way to sum up this topic is with a quote by the great Dalai Lama; “When educating the minds of our youth, we must not forget to educate their hearts”. When both the mind and heart are empowered, that is called a complete education and that is exactly what NLP does.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

This can be dampening for the entrepreneur, which in turn could push him to face dejection and give up on his dreams.</p>\n<p><strong>The Entrepreneur and Entrepreneurship</strong></p>\n<p>Dictionary meaning: An entrepreneur is a person who sets up a business or businesses, taking on financial risks in the hope of making profits. Entrepreneurship is the process of designing, launching and running a new business, which is often initially a small business, with the capacity and willingness to develop, organize and manage a business venture along with any of its risks to make a profit.The people who create these businesses are often referred to as entrepreneurs</p>\n<p><strong>Some qualities ‘Boosters’ required in entrepreneurs to become successful</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Very high levels of motivation</li><li>Passion to make it work, come what may</li><li>Precise decision making skills</li><li>Communication and negotiation skills</li><li>Optimism, the start is fine but as challenges come in one after the other, and optimistic mindset which says, all is well, keep moving</li><li>Willingness to take risks</li><li>Excellent interpersonal skills</li><li>Ownership in all aspects of the business</li><li>Skilled and Resourceful</li><li>Creative and Innovative</li></ul>\n<p>These are just few of the qualities that every entrepreneur must have.  This can happen only when the entrepreneurhasnot only their conscious, but also theirunconscious mind under control. Entrepreneur can only then become successful and have a satisfying entrepreneurial journey, ie. when they have a good understanding of mind and matter and are able to control their own mind first and make it work in their best interests.  To make this happen, NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) has many strategies and tools at its disposal that can be a boon to existing and potential entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>Before we learn about few of the tools that NLP has, at its disposal, let us understand the challenges faced by entrepreneurs.  This will give us an idea where the NLP tools can be used, in the best and sure fire way to empower success.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges that Entrepreneurs face</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Anxiety and stress from doing everything under pressure situations, due to lack of experienced/skilled resources</li><li>Dwindling self-confidence and Low motivational levels – Feeling of being lost, losing the sense of what got you started in the first place.  Positive enthusiasm with which the business was started gets replaced with criticism and self-doubt</li><li>Lack of Capital &amp; Cash Flow Management –Many times, it takes years for businesses to even reach a cost to cost cash inflow situation.Many times, due to whatever reasons, business is not very great and it takes a long time for clients to make payments. Continuous inflow of money is very necessary for small business survival, yet many entrepreneurs struggle to pay bills, salaries and other day to day expenses. Many times, the entrepreneur is left without anything, not even a salary, profits remain a far-off dream. This is a huge reason to become de-motivated</li><li>Marketing strategy – since the business might not have overly huge marketing budget or could not afford to employ experienced people to do the right marketing, businesses find it difficult to get the correct reach or number of clients to make the desired profits</li><li>Finding paying clients –Another issue is finding clients and business with regularity. Many times meetings are held, quotes are drawn but then the entrepreneur reaches a dead end when the client backs off.  Much time, efforts and resources are invested in order to crack a certain deal.  It is very painful when the client backs out and the order is lost.  To add to this today’s businesses are high on competition</li><li>Building a Successful Team – Efficient human capital forms the back bone of any business – big or small. Small businesses find it difficult to employ efficient and highly paid experienced talent since neither do they have the infrastructure or the money to pay for their services</li></ul>\n<p>But, all is not lost. All these challenges can be easily overcome by any person who has his conscious and unconscious mind under control. One can achieve such balanced mental state with the help of Neuro-Linguistic Programming tools and proven strategiesthat can help entrepreneurs meet challenges with the much-needed focus and acumen and achieve the success they had initially set out to achieve.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s all in the mind.  What we must do is, to take control over what and how it should be.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>NLP – The Entrepreneurs Savior</strong></p>\n<p>A budding entrepreneur is motivated by dreams of success.  His/her level of motivation depends on how much success is experienced. To keep the motivation consistent, even during highs and lows in business, becomes a challenge.  If the lows outweigh the highs, it will bring down the motivational level and could even make the entrepreneur quit.</p>\n<p>The most important aspects to keep up the motivation levels, are for the entrepreneur to think success, do success, plan success, act success. For this miracle to happen, NLP can help an entrepreneur in many important improvement areas, some of which are given below:</p>\n<ul><li>Help cultivate the necessary communication and inter-personal skills using the required power words, body language and mental strength</li><li>Help achievea subtle alignment and balance between the conscious and unconscious mind to factor building of focus and vision towards business goals</li><li>Help create a vision through mind maps and then re-create the same in reality</li><li>Help break out from the web of unproductive habits and get rid of all distractions</li><li>Empower through the understanding and application of various tools of NLP, to take complete control of the mental and emotional states of self as well as team and customers/clients</li><li>To envision, and strategically think and make effective and smart decisions</li><li>To engage in different internal states, use them to create, launch and manage products, ideas and projects</li><li>To shift patterns of communication, re-write limiting belief scripts and create a winning mindset</li><li>To function better within self as an entrepreneur and with team as a manager/boss</li><li>Activates usage of Critical thinking, Visionary thinking, Leadership attributes, Quality Practices and more with NLP frames</li></ul>\n<p><strong>To conclude:</strong></p>\n<p>Want to shift to a powerful Business, Entrepreneurial and Success Programming Mindset.

How can we be limitless? Ironically, by limiting our limiting beliefs.</p>\n<p>A ‘belief’ is anopinion or decision we make about ourselves, our environment, and the world we live in. These are the opinions and decisions that chart out the way we live. These beliefs are born out of various experiences, causes, meanings, identities and so on and soon become a part of us that drive all our thinkingand decisions. They soon become such an integral part of us that we become so bound to them, they soon become the ones controlling us. It is these beliefs that turn into limiting beliefs, so much so that nothing new is allowed in, nor any difference of opinion is welcomed.  These beliefssettle inside our system, within our internal world, shaping our responses to the external world and opportunities around us.</p>\n<p>Many a time, such limiting beliefs, handicap our growth. Ever wonder why certain things happen to us again and again.  Take for example, we try to get a certain project.  Everything is handled splendidly, right from meetings to negotiations to documentation.  But at the last minute the project slips out of our hands.  Why does this happen?  Months before exams, we study hard, night and day, but when the results come, we have just scraped through as compared to some students who didn’t even put in half the effort?</p>\n<p>This happens because we are controlled by our limiting beliefs. In some way or the other, many times sub-consciously, our beliefs tell us we are no good and that we don’t deserve the success.  Once established, these beliefs become so deeply entrenched into our sub-conscious that whenever we are out there trying to achieve something, our sub-conscious is very softly whispering to us – ‘no you can’t’. And we fail or just scrape through. If such things are constantly happening to us, it’s time to introspect.  Time to take help from an experienced NLP Life Coach or Coaching programs and find what are the beliefs we have, which is limiting us.  It could be in the form of words, actions, thoughts, so on.</p>\n<p>When these negative experiences keep happening again and again, in various area of our life, it leadsus to believe that “I have really bad luck in becoming successful” or “I am a bad businessman”, or “I am unlucky in relationships”. From then on, we focus only on the negative aspects whenever we try to clinch a deal, or are in a relationship.  When we think negative, we get negative results and slowlyit confirms what we believe is true. Then, unconsciously weseek projects or partners who conform to this belief. Thus belief influences action and becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  This then becomes a circle of events, that keep getting repeated, time and again leading us to create more and more limiting beliefs.</p>\n<p><strong><u>It’s Time to SPOT and STOP these Limiting Beliefs</u></strong></p>\n<p>Neuro Linguistic Programming NLP, a science which has huge success in changing the way we think. It works on the theory that our beliefs affect the way we act in the world, and vice versa. And one of the key Tools of NLP is the attempt to change our beliefs in order to address negative behavior patterns and replace it with positive and progressive behavior patterns and beliefs.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Content Reframe or Re-framing your Belief Content</u></strong></p>\n<p>Changing or altering embedded beliefs,that has found home in our unconscious is no easy task. Remember, the ideal way to go about it is to avoid accumulation of negative beliefs by continuously performing content reframe.  But one can do this only when one is aware of it.  Better late than never. If and when negative beliefs develop, we gather evidence to counter what we believe is wrong.  It is possible we may be right, however painful it might be.  Not all our beliefs are wrong. Hence it is very important to get facts right.</p>\n<p>Write down the positive and negative points of the belief that is being targeted and the thoughts that drive these beliefs. When we keep doing this exercise, slowly we start seeing positive patterns developing.</p>\n<p>We must lookat all the positive aspects of our belief, just don’t seek out the negative.  Once we are sure that the negatives outweighs the positives, and that the belief is not helping our growth in any manner, we re-frame our belief content. From our belief of ‘I am no good’,   What we are aiming for, is to formulate a one sentence summary of our new belief; from“I have really bad luck in becoming successful” or “I am a bad businessman”, or “I am unlucky in relationships”, re-write all these with, for example – “I am empowered to have success/ do excellent in my exams/ have positive, loving, fulfilling relationships” and so on.  The re-framed content are also called positive affirmations.</p>\n<p>It does not end here.  It took us so many years to embed our limiting beliefs.  It definitely will take some time to replace them with the new re-framed content. With new fulfilling beliefs.  So, the next step would be to focus entirely on the new, positive affirmation/s for around five minutes each day.</p>\n<p>How canwe do it? Find a quiet place and space, away from distractions, so that our focus is entirely on the task at hand – embedding the new re-framed beliefs. We must ignore everything around us for some space of time. Just be with ourselves and our thoughts. Do this with diligence and within a few weeks of practice,we will have developed a strong mental image of our new belief.</p>\n<p>After around 3 weeks of this practice,we begin to see effects of the new beliefs system, in our everyday life. Wesee differences, that will make us stronger, more confident and as we start achieving, our belief in ourselves will grow stronger and stronger giving us the success we have strived for.</p>\n<p><strong>In conclusion:</strong></p>\n<p>By mastering such life enhancing NLP tools and strategies, we can change the way we think and focus.  We startlooking at the past, and future with a different mindset. Since we now know the method, of effectively re-framing our limiting beliefs, we become more confident in communicating with the outside world. With our communication abilities our emotional intelligence also improves. These are just a few techniques to make us aware of the power of NLP in creating a life we want to live. NLP has tools and strategies for any of life’s challenges and is the best guide, a sciencethat can empower us, to help us live a life that is limitless.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

Yes, becoming a mother changes one’s life, drastically. A period of nine months, changes you from being a shrewd independent working woman to a caring and loving mother, whose focal point becomes her child. It is the same feeling for fathers too, because a child gives birth to a Father, too. Initially it may all come up as a big surprise but as time passes, it turns out like beauty and complication in a single frame. AWESOME! Not so simple as the child grows up, the changing phases that parents need to adapt to, especially when the child is going through the “the pre-school phase, school phase, teen phase and so on”.</p>\n<p>It is during these phases that the child starts getting an understanding of the world. They grow not only in terms of their cognitive abilities but the physical growth is immense. Quite challenging, in today’s fast paced world where a majority of both parents are working.  Managing a child’s homework with your office presentation and household chores can be quite daunting for a mother. For a father, the whole concept of raising a child can make him run into the first safe corner.  Raising a child is not a one day, one month or one year responsibility.  It goes on, in various phases, till the child is capable and able to start taking decisions on his/her own.Also understand that in a child’s development, the father and mother are a team.</p>\n<p>Child raising is hair raising, but there is help on the way.  A good knowledge of NLP – Neuro linguistic Programing strategies and tools can be used to become a better parent and that is what’s required, especially in today’s scenario where children are so headstrong and many times unmanageable.  NLP helps you achieve the balance that need to be formed.  The first step here would be to understand the different types of parenting styles that exist in the human development branch of psychology. </p>\n<p><strong><u>PARENTING  STYLES</u></strong></p>\n<p>When raising a child, the father and mother are a team.  It would be good for the child’s benefit, that both support each other in raising their child. But sometimes, personality comes in the way.  Each person, their value system, their methods, and environment are different. There are bound to be conflicts, dissatisfaction, and various other emotions in the process. It is therefore important that awareness and balance is created, with each other’s buy-in.</p>\n<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>TYPES OF PARENTS</strong></td><td><strong>HOW CAN YOU BALANCE?</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1. Authoritarian Parenting:</strong> Parents here establish rules that their children have to blindly follow. The child hardly gets involved in decisions. Their opinion is not asked for and they are only required to obey their parents’ orders. This makes them low on self-esteem.</td><td>When one parent is authoritative the other can be supportive enough so that the child does not find it very overpowering and withdraws into his shell. The child can be confident if he knows that he can share with his parents and that they are there for him.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2. Authoritative Parenting</strong>: They have rules but they are also willing to consider their child’s point of view. They are ready to give reasons for their decisions, and understand their child’s emotions. Children with such parents are generally happy, successful and more expressive.</td><td>This type of parenting is the right method as there is discipline, guidance, empowerment and love.  All that is required to give the child, the correct upbringing.  But parents have to be careful to be flexible as the child grows up and enters different life phases. They will have to change their parenting style accordingly. </td></tr><tr><td><strong>3. Permissive Parenting</strong>: They don’t want to rule their child’s life. So they are quite lenient and little friendlier. This makes the child a little rude and arrogant.  So much that many times they don’t even respect their parents or elders and get offended when anyone tries to discipline them.</td><td>In their growing years the child cannot differentiate between good and bad, necessary and unnecessary.  There is also a need for the child grows up with values and the right perspective.  A child gets all these learning from parents and elders.  In order that the child gains all these and more, it is important for the parents to set some rules and regulations and insist on the child obeying them. It is never bad for the child to get some disciplining at that age.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>4. Uninvolved Parenting</strong>: They are the “never-mind” type parents. There are more things other than their kids which makes them happy. The problem of less attachment is faced between parent and child.</td><td>Having a child and raising him well, so that he does not become a social nuisance is very important.  Parents who are uninvolved in their child’s life should decide not to have children in the first place, as many such children later on either get depressed, get into bad company, are difficult to get along with or become a social nuisance as they have not been given the right guidance, care or love.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<p><br/><strong>5. Situational Parenting</strong>:  This kind of parenting can be merged with the first 3 parenting styles to create a parenting style that would go well with today’s generation kids. I have found this to be quite effective.  In this style of parenting, the parents could have a prominent style but sometimes be flexible to allow changes as per the situation.  This is because today’s children are more informed, slightly less on tolerance, have access to more comforts and luxuries, and like to be empowered.  They have a voice of their own.  It would get a little difficult to push a lot of rules and regulations on them but the beauty of this generation is they are aware of pros and cons and are willing to listen to reason if explained in a manner they understand.  A tough task but worth a try. (A tip – get their buy-in for anything you want to enforce.)</p>\n<p><strong><u>The NLP Communication Tool</u></strong></p>\n<p>Communication is and will always remain one of the most important and strongest factor in making, breaking or nurturing relationships. Parents, many a time, start with the best of intentions, in their daily role of parenting, but sometimes end up traumatizing their children, are unable to get them to obey them or sometimes fail to even understand how they should approach their children.  When the child disobeys or rebels, the parents get angrier and vent out their frustration by using the wrong choice of words and gestures that upsets the child even further and pushes them even more into their shell.</p>\n<p>You get your response as per the meaning your communication gives. This is a principle that coaches work with in NLP.  What is important here is, to take responsibility for the response that we get from our communications.  More importantly, know how to communicate, how to use the right words and contexts. This kind of communication also requires you to be flexible.  This is another NLP principle.</p>\n<p>Why this? Because children don’t stay the same, always. They go through different phases, but like many adults, they are not rigid and do not stick to one like, moods, fads, fashions or temperament for long.  They are very flexible and they keep moving on.</p>\n<p>Another NLP principle, ‘The law of requisite variety states that the part with the most variability controls the system’.  What does this mean?  Simply put it means, the more flexible our thought processes, language patterns and behavior,the more likely we will always be at the top. And this principle is not just to deal with kids.  This works in life, in general, especially for people who are in charge or who lead.</p>\n<p>This kind of communication, and the alternative choice of words one would use, after getting the understanding of NLP tools would be as follows:</p>\n<p>A couple had organized a get-together for family and close friends.  They welcomed their guests, who had arrived in large numbers. The lady was on her feet serving the guests. Their teen daughter was on her mobile.  The guests kept demanding for more drinks and eatables. The woman turned in frustration to their teen daughter and shouted, “Well don’t just sit there wasting time.  Can’t you see that I need help?  Why don’t you help me?”</p>\n<p>The girl was taken aback and replied, “I didn’t know you wanted help”.</p>\n<p>This made the mother angry. “Are you dumb?  Couldn’t you see I needed help?”  Now carry these trays for me. The girl was visibly upset as the mother had reprimanded her so openly.  Even her father was giving her some angry looks. The girl was clearlytraumatized by the treatment given by her parents.</p>\n<p><strong>What went wrong in this communication?</strong></p>\n<p>The statement, “Can’t you see that I need some help”. The mother was expecting her daughter to read her mind. She assumes that the child should know what she is thinking and feeling.</p>\n<p>The question, “Why don’t you help me?”.  And the girl replied,matter of fact, “I didn’t know you wanted help”.</p>\n<p>As parents, asking “Why” to your child will only get you a list of reasons to justify the “Why”. The solution is to shift the focus onto what you do want.  Set expectations and be assertive.  In this case, if the mother needed some assistance, all she needed to do was to ask in a way that stated the desired outcome.</p>\n<p>The mother could have just said what she needed to say in the first place, but in an even tone and not as a command “Here, carry these dishes for me and leave them on the sink”is assertive but not a command.  Specify what you want to get done.</p>\n<p><strong>What a parent needs to know.</strong></p>\n<p>Conversations between Parent and Child.  Please note the words used and the meanings and response to them.</p>\n<ol type="1"><li>Parent to child: “Vicky, can you please go and clean your room?” (Request)</li></ol>\n<p>Vicky: “Later mum.” OR</p>\n<p>Vicky: “Not now mum I am watching TV.”</p>\n<ul><li>Parent to child: “Vicky, I just asked you to please go and clean your room.” (Angry command with Request)</li></ul>\n<p>Vicky: “Mum I am doing something.”</p>\n<ul><li>Parent to child: “Vicky, how many times do I have to ask you to go and clean your room?” (Angry, Reprimanding)</li></ul>\n<p>Child: “But I don’t want to.”  You are always shouting at me.</p>\n<p>All that the parent needed to say was, “Go and finish cleaning your room now and be ready for dinner by 8.30am”.  Specific – Assertive – Non-negotiable.</p>\n<p>The above is a transcript between a parent and child. The parent gradually raises his or her voice, gets more frustrated and angry with the child’s behavior.  When this happens, the child’s emotional responses intensify leading to frustration, anger and tears, which in turn leads to self-pity and playing the victim. The child accepts that the parents are always angry and that this is their behavior. Then suddenly, due to whatever reason, the parents, of course with positive intention, tries to be nice to the child, whilst what he really wants is for the child to obey him. They politely and nicely asks him to do it. Any wonder the child is confused.  The moot point here is, again, Specific – Assertive – Non-negotiable. No command, No anger, No frustration, No pleading.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Wrapping It Up.</u></strong></p>\n<p>Taking all methods into consideration, there is no particular method a parent should stick to. However children grow the best with the authoritative style of parenting, which is again mostly about being specific and assertive. Considering parenting as a subjective topic, different parents have different opinions when it comes to parenting.  While some may consider a combination style – the permissive with authoritative style, others may consider only the authoritarian style. What one should however keep in mind is, what so ever style you choose, the main aim should be the child grows to be an independent and happy individual. It is only after parents learn the perfect way of handling their child, that they are able to have a great ‘parent-child’ relationship.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

It’s very simple when you look at it. Any one of us can bring success in our work and within our lives. How? By eliminating the mindset of CAN’T! We hear many motivational messages, for example – Nothing is Impossible, You Can Do It, and so on. All these messages are true! It is because we can do anything we choose to. It is a choice! If we choose not to succeed, we’re staying in a small box with a small mindset. People who choose to succeed, go outside that box. Just like that.</p>\n<p>Changing our mindset is no easy task, since it is developed over a period of time and is a result of some strong internal and external factors.  Our mindset propels the choices we make for our physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Many times the choices we make in these directions are a result of the mindset we acquire as per our environment, emotions, relationships, incidents, religion, beliefs and so on. Many of these factors, instead of developing us and allowing us to grow, pull us back. Just something as simple as being aware, and changing our thinking can change our life. Having an open and positive mindset is a game changer.</p>\n<p>Neuro-lingustic programming (NLP) can help us spot and change negative thought patterns, assumptions and processes, thus allowing us to live a more enjoyable and meaningful life.Success is a state of mind and not an elusive phenomenon. To crack this, we have to understand the psychology of success so that we can overcome failure. NLP helps us crack this very well. We will have a separate blog on the Psychology of Success.  Here we will concentrate on how NLP can help us change our mindset to achieve success in life.</p>\n<p>The great thing about Mind-Set is that it’s not ‘set’ in stone! It can be changed. NLP shows few ways (part of NLP Tools and Strategies) that canchange our thinking, enabling usto change our life</p>\n<ol type="1"><li><strong>Being Awareand Choosing our Mind State.</strong></li></ol>\n<p>One powerful way to do this is to actually consciously recognise how our mindset is influencing our thoughts and actions. When working towards a goal or dealing with a situation, instead of rushing headlong into the process with the same mindset and approach we would normally have, we should take a step back, stop and ask our self what our likely state of mind is and should be.</p>\n<p>There are two aspects that can drive our decisions. Paranoia or Pronoia. If it is paranoia, we operate from a total state of fear about our activity where we feel everybody and everything is against us. (Note, this is not as having the medical condition – paranoia.) If it is pronoia, we operate from the mind state that everythingand everybody are on our side. Now we have to consider the actions and outcomes of operating from both these mind states. If we operate from the fear state, the outcome would be self-doubt, distrust and failures. But with a changed mind set, if we operate from the pronoia state, the outcome would bemotivation and success. Just think about it. If weare truly honest with ourselves, that wereally want to succeed, then we would naturally opt for pronoia.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Just Do It</strong></p>\n<p>Many times we do not feel like doing something we have committed to do. We procrastinate and keep shifting the tasks to another day.  We are sure we will get it completed next day, i.e. If Tomorrow Comes. Not feeling like exercising? Do it anyway. Not feeling like finishing the article, just do it anyway. Push yourself. The payout, that is, the joy of completing what we have set out to do and fulfilling a commitment, is huge. Not just that, as we get into a habit of fulfilling commitments, it increases our self-confidence, and slowly our mindset begins to change and we start our journey towards success with the new growth mindset.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Anchoring</strong></p>\n<p>One of the strongest and commonly practised NLP technique. People have so many beliefs and experiences that limit them from achieving their potential. The goal of anchoring is to elicit positive responses at will, by associating a particular mental and emotional state to an anchor, which can be an image, a word, or a gesture.</p>\n<p>We have practiced anchoring many times in our lives, consciously or unconsciously. I remember, when I was in school, and wanted to break my habit of nail biting, I would put a rubber band on my wrist.  Anytime I felt like biting my nail, I would snap the rubber band.  The sting of the rubber band snapping on my wrist would anchor me to my resolution not to bite my nails. We set up NLP anchors to intentionally feel resourceful in the right situations. In NLP, “anchoring” refers to the process of associating an internal response with some external or internal trigger so that the response may be quickly, and sometimes covertly, re-accessed.</p>\n<p>Let’s understand this with an example.</p>\n<p>You have been feeling demotivated lately and this attitude is creating a negative influence where your work is concerned, your emotions are concerned.  You know you have to and want to come out of this state.  How anchoring can help you?  You can do it yourself or attend a program where an experienced NLP Practitioner can help you anchor.</p>\n<ul><li>Sit in a quiet place.</li><li>Think of the situation that is troubling you. Park it.</li><li>Now think of a time or situation that brought you joy and happiness.</li><li>Bring in sensory cues associated with that state (e.g. what you saw, felt, smelt, heard).</li><li>Bring this memory to its most intense point and then associate your feelings to an anchor (e.g. twist a ring on your finger, press the thumb or your right hand onto the palm of your left hand, or press your thumb and forefinger together).  Anchor the pleasant feeling there.</li></ul>\n<p>Take a short break and repeat the steps above.</p>\n<p>Now whenever you need an emotional pick-me-up, you can repeat this exercise.  The minute you do, you recollect the happy memories thus transferring your current sad or unhappy emotional state to a happy and confident state.  Do this with awareness.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Say ‘No No’ to Comfort Zones</strong></p>\n<p>We all have comfort zones that we have so lovingly created for ourselves. It’s a very cozy and safe zone we have created for ourselves.  Trust me, it would be very difficult for even wild horses to drag me out of my comfort zone if I did not want to.</p>\n<p>But that’s exactly what we must do.  Time and again, if we are looking for growth and success, we must come out of our comfort zone. Our mindset will only begin to change if we allow ourselves to be exposed to the possibilities of change. Although it will make us feel a bit uncomfortable at first, we slowly start looking at things from a different viewpoint, thus opening doors to various opportunities for growth</p>\n<p><strong>5. Eliminate ‘NOs’to Create ‘YESs’. Make it Happen</strong></p>\n<p>Stop your ‘but’s’. I think I can do this, but….;.  I want to come to the seminar, but…..; I have a good knowledge about this subject and can speak on it, but……  STOP YOUR BUTs!</p>\n<p>We could also be creating our ‘buts’.  This is important. For instance, “I want to lose 10 kgsbut I’m so busy, I don’t get time to exercise or go to the gym; ” “I want to buy my own home, but I have some old debts to pay off and cannot afford now,” “I want to do that course, but I don’t have the time or finances for that.”</p>\n<p>Now how would it be it we eliminate the “but”.  Just imagine how it would feel if these external factors weren’t really a problem.</p>\n<p>This can be done with a simple but powerful technique in changing our thinking. All we do is tap into our emotions and eliminate the roadblocks that takes up so much of our energy because we are focusing so hard on it. Instead, we begin to shift our focus from the but’s and toward the “how’s.”How can I do it? How can I make it happen?  What are the ways?  Write it down.  Create an action plan.  Act on it and make it happen.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong> Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) main objective is to help us live a more enjoyable and meaningful life. Although, where solutions are concerned, one cap doesn’t fit all.  Changing mindset is work in progress but definitely rewarding. Slowly with a deeper understanding of ourselves, we get into the habit of making the right decisions and approaching life and it moments in a more positive and confident manner.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

We all have twenty-four hour days.”…..</em></strong>Zig Ziglar <strong><u> </u></strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<p>Such beautiful words, quoted by such great successful men. And how true they are, how true. When I summed up the meaning of the above quotes, what I could understand is – success is all about having focus and the right attitude.</p>\n<p><strong>Why do we lose focus and concentration?</strong>  There could be many reasons – some internal, whereas some reasons are external. Let us understand these aspects with an example.  (Case scenarios are different for each one of us, but losing focus is a big hurdle that we all have and that we have to overcome.)</p>\n<p>Martha, a young executive, has been given a project to complete, within a deadline of four days. She is part of a very energetic team and she knows her job well. Although Martha had taken up the project, she has some personal issues which had to be sorted. Also, she was just back from a long business tour and had a lot of catching up to do. To add to that, Martha’s work station was bang opposite the reception area.  What are the factors that could lead to Martha not being able to finish her project on time? What are the factors that could meddle with her concentration and focus?</p>\n<p>We can segregate the reasons into internal and external factors:</p>\n<p><strong>Internal Factors</strong>–Fatigue and lack of sleep due to the long journey.  Stress and mental pressures due to personal issues she is facing. Worry about the backlog and future project deadlines, internal talks, racing thoughts, all these could lead to loss of focus.</p>\n<p><strong>External Factors – </strong>The reasons could be from different channels of communication, mainly visual, auditory and kinesthetic channels. Since Martha sits close to the reception, people’s movement could be a distraction.  Also the continuous phone calls at the reception. Her current workload which could soon become urgent, along with her mobile phone where she is continuously getting phone calls – private and official, can be a distraction. To add to all these, colleagues who would drop in for a small chat or favor, boss’s disturbance, guests asking the way to someone’s cabin, etc.</p>\n<p>Not in this case, but external factors can also be noise of vehicles or loud music, too cold or too hot temperature, bad seating arrangement, bad infrastructure, so on and so forth.</p>\n<p><strong>How can we improve our focus?</strong></p>\n<p>Our time, energy, and focus are not limitless. Nor will age treat us nicely forever, with kiddy gloves. All of them will eventually run out, sometime. It makes absolute sense then to use these factors wisely and get the most out of it. In this blog we will concentrate on building our focus, because without having the right amount of focus, neither time nor energy will help us achieve our goals, leaving us dissatisfied in life.</p>\n<p>Focus?  Is it easy for one to be focused in today’s world?  No matter how much we work, plan, motivate ourselves to reach and achieve our goals, life is so full of technology cluttered distractions, that pull our attention away from what we want to achieve. So how do we build focus, how do we pull our attention away from distractions and focus on what we want to achieve?</p>\n<p>Neuro-linguistic Programming (NLP) shows us some excellent ways to overcome distractions and build focus.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Through Dissociation</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Dissociation is a very powerful NLP tool to work on distractions and build focus.  Whatever the problem may be, NLP trains you to stop reacting in negative or overly emotional ways. Instead, NLP teaches you ways you can dissociate from the immediate emotional reaction and choose how you to want to respond. Response through choice.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Through Anchoring</strong></li></ul>\n<p>A great technique to help you improve your ability to deal with emotional or adverse situations by anchoring yourself to more pleasant memories and incidents.  For example, when you are in an emotional or troubled state, you can remember a good memory that would bring peace and a smile to your lips. Think of that memory and push the thumb of your right hand onto the center of the palm of your left hand and anchor the pleasant thought.  Now, whenever any sad or emotional thoughts come, repeat the thumb and palm exercise and you will feel the tension easing away, you will experience a calming effect.  You can also push your finger and thumb together. The anchoring technique (conditioning), is one of the most powerful tools in NLP.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Through Rapport</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Where communication and relationship building is concerned, Rapport is one of the most powerful NLP techniques you can use because it can help you build trust and understanding very quickly with almost anyone.  This will lessen miscommunicationgiving you the freedom to focus on achieving your goals.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Through Extending Restrictions</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Sometimes whilst working or it could be studying, our mind starts wandering and we feel like taking a break because we cannot focus anymore. At such times, we should stop ourselves from taking a break. We should extend our restriction by forcing ourselves to work or study for some more time, maybe half hour or so. In this technique, it is important to determine the goal, in this case we extended it by half hour. Determine short goals like, finishing a page of the book you are reading or working for another half hour.  Remember, your goal should not be to try to complete the work. Then you would not be successful in achieving your goal. Extendinglimitations helps you walk that extra mile. </p>\n<p><strong><u>In Conclusion.</u></strong></p>\n<p>Building focus and concentration takes time and effort. Fine tune your abilities to remove distractions with the right tools and the right attitude.Make life simple. Always start your day on a positive note, with determination and intention of having a productive day.  Set 3-4 targets for each day and set out to achieve it. Review your achievements of the day and don’t be too hard on yourself if everything was not achieved.  Schedule it for the next day. Slowly and steadily this becomes a winning habit, an investment that will be worth it, to cultivate and nurture.  Your habits will soon become your assets.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

Whilst the brain, we also call it the mind, is considered to be the logical twin, the heart is the emotional one. The best part is, decisions are made by both of them. I am talking about the heart and the brain because they are part of the subject of this blog where I am trying to simplify the Pleasure and Pain Concept.</p>\n<p><strong>Let us first study the pleasure concept in brief.</strong></p>\n<p>The pleasure concept is a term originally used by Sigmund Freud to characterize the tendency of people to seek pleasure and avoid pain. Freud argued that people will sometimes go to great lengths to avoid even momentary pain, particularly at times of psychological weakness or vulnerability. Pain is not something any of us like,to the extent that, we would go to any length to avoid pain.  But pleasure; well that is a different story.</p>\n<p>We all know the model of the psyche – ID, EGO and SUPER EGO. According to Sigmund Freud’s personality theory (1923), the psyche is structured into three parts, the id, ego and superego.  They all keep developing at various stages in our lives. These are systems, not parts of the brain, or in any way physical.</p>\n<p>The pleasure principle is driven by the id, which is a part of the unconscious, dedicated to pleasure and base drives. According to Freud, it is the id that rules our personality in infancy and early childhood, which is later taken over by the ego and superego,which develops as we grow older. The influence of the ego and superego can mitigate the influence of the id, but the pleasure principle still remains an important part of our underlying personality. At any point in life, we try to avoid pain.  This is our id at work.</p>\n<p>Let’s starts from an early age.  Ever watched a child’s behavior? Whatever they do, children tend to seek immediate gratification. They only want pleasure and joy in what they do and get, and avoid pain as much as possible. However, as the child grows up, they are exposed to various situations and circumstances which change their behavior and make them more realistic about their desires.  They slowlybegin to realise that at times they must tolerate pain and delay gratification, either because of constraints of life or because the pain could be for a larger good. With this realization,children start operating under the reality principle, which still seeks pleasure, but without disregarding the constraints of reality.Needless to say, even when operating under the reality principle, a person may still experience behavioral disturbances when needs for pleasure are not met or when he or she experiences unwanted pain.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting a deeper understanding of the Pleasure and Pain Concept will enable you to get a better grip on your life. Few points and examplesto elaborate this further….There is a flow to it that you need to understand well.</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Human Beings are programmed to Avoid Pain and Gain Pleasure</strong></li></ul>\n<p>If you had two choices, what would you choose – pain or pleasure?  Most obviously pleasure would be your first answer. You would pick the one that gives you more pleasure and the one that gives you less pain. So if I say – Here, I have a slice of yummy cheese cake, (knowing that you love cheese cake) and I have this bitter gourd juice. Please choose what you will have? What would you prefer? Obviously, the yummy cheese cake.  Eating it would give you pleasure.</p>\n<p>Fine.  But now we go to the next point</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Avoiding pain is more important to Human Beings Than Gaining Pleasure</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Pleasure is their id factor.  But with age and understanding, they start to get realistic.  Even still, human beings will go a great extent to avoid pain, than they will to gain pleasure. So yes, you will prefer to eat the cheese cake than have the bitter gourd juice. What if you have to watch your health and cheese cake is not good for you?  What if the bitter gourd, although painful to drink, is the better option? Now the concept has changed in your mind, hasn’t it?</p>\n<p>Now you see the pain and the pleasure of the cheese cake and the pain and pleasure of the bitter gourd juice and here you have to make a choice. Obviously your brain knows what is going to give you less pain in the long run andwill select accordingly, because we are programmed to do more to avoid pain than to gain pleasure.  It will select the bitter gourd juice since it is the healthier option and will not harm you.</p>\n<p>Now moving to the next flow – our next point. This is very interesting and people need to be more aware of this.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Its more Perception than reality</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Perception plays a huge role in the pain and pleasure concept.  The perception theory states that it is not necessary that you want to do more to avoid pain and gain pleasure.  It is the perception of pain and pleasure that guides our reactions and decisions.</p>\n<p>For example, the brain doesn’t really know what is pleasurable and what is painful. It is how you perceive that particular experience. Do I perceive it to be painful or do I perceive it to be pleasurable?</p>\n<p>So here it is not actually drinking of the bitter gourd juice that is painful, but the fact that you perceive that the juice is going to taste so bad and the struggle to swallow, that is going to hurt you. Your perception creates your reality, even though it is not the reality, your brain sticks to it, that it will be painful to drink it. So you’ll do more to avoid pain than to gain pleasure. This explains whymany of us make irrational decisions that we later regret.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Emotion v/s Logic – Emotion wins</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Pleasure and Pain are two sides of a coin that can motivate us to take decisions and act on them.   Pleasure makes us happy and we generally have a positive attitude towards pleasurable things.  On the other hand, pain feels bad and brings out a negative attitude towards anything that causes it.   It is our attitude towards both of these that rules our decisions. Be aware that always, the emotional pain or pleasure is much stronger than the logical one. Hence the stronger feeling emotions triumphs over logic all the time. When put simply, it means that, when something is going to hurt your heart you will do anything in order to avoid that hurt or pain. Logic doesn’t stand a chance in such situations. Your heartwill overrideyour mind more easily than vice versa.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>When you have to choose Survival against Desire, Survival Wins</strong></li></ul>\n<p>People love themselves.  While it is true that that people will sometimes go to great lengths to avoid even momentary pain, if we consider everything, survival always beats desire. Again, if I offered cheese cake and bitter gourd juice to a diabetic, he would choose the juice instead of the cake because he knows the cake is harmful for his health. This is because as human beings we’re programmed for survival, we are not programmed to thrive. So when you know you are in danger, your survival instincts come to the fore. This is an emotional trait right. So as said before – emotions win!  It would be in your best interests to make your survival instincts work for you instead of against you.</p>\n<p><strong>In conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>All of the emotional experiences you have had are a result of how you interpreted your experiences at that particular time. So your pain and pleasure experiences are your personal interpretations based on your perspectives at the time. Since these are personal experiences and personal interpretations of those experiences, we can understand that we all will have different experiences and our interpretations of those experiences will vary from each other. What would be poison for you could be nectar for some other person.  What you interpret as a painful experience, another person might interpret as a pleasurable experience.</p>\n<p>Take a moment to reflect on these experiences and you will gain valuable insights to this whole Pain and Pleasure Concept. In the end, trust your survival instinct to take the right decisions and push you forward.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

It was popular and encouraged even by family members. Going for a smoke or two was a trend accepted by many.  This holds true even today, although awareness about the drastic effects caused by smoking has stopped many youngsters from making it habit. Some places have even banned smoking in public enclosed spaces due to the alarming increase in numbers of passive smokers. </p>\n<p>Active smoking is a killer, let’s face it, especially when it becomes a habit. First one puff, feels good, then another, feels even better and the journey of a smoker begins. Then it forms a habit that is not only difficult, but nearly impossible to break, without expert help.</p>\n<p>It is not just active smoking that is dangerous, but even passive smokers are at a risk of certain cancers, and heart disease, serious lung illness and a host of other ailments if exposed to active smokers, since they breathe in the smoke let out by the puffers.  It is nearly as bad a health risks as for active smokers.</p>\n<p><strong>The health hazards of smoking are many. To point out a few:</strong></p>\n<p>Smoking damages your heart and blood circulation, increasing risks of</p>\n<ul><li>Coronary heart disease</li><li>Heart attack and stroke</li><li>Peripheral vascular disease (damaged blood vessels)</li><li>Cerebrovascular disease (damaged arteries that supply blood to your brain)</li><li>Damages lungs, leading to conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in layman language – bronchitis and emphysema and causes pneumonia</li><li>In men, smoking is known to cause impotence and can reduce the fertility of both men and women</li><li>Smoking is the cause of almost 7 out of every 10 cases of lung cancer (70%).  It also causes cancer of various other internal body parts</li></ul>\n<p>Knowing the health hazards, many of which are life-threatening, why do so many people take up smoking and continue to smoke in spite of the hazards?</p>\n<p>Maybe they didn’t start with the intention of making it a habit.  Maybe it was a dare, peer pressure, a temporary stress buster, wanting to look cool or fit in with friends.  Anything could have been the reason.  Then as the consumption increased, it became very difficult to let go.  Many might have even tried to stop the habit, but the withdrawal symptoms were so intense, they would find no choice but go back to it.  It became a type of dependency, that if you give up one habit it gets replaced by some other habit like drinking or binge eating, which are also life-threatening.</p>\n<p><strong>How can an expert help a person to quit smoking?</strong></p>\n<p>Since habits are formed, first in the mind and then takes a physical form, NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) tools are a sure-fire way used to stop the craving for smoking.  A therapy using a combination of Clinical Hypnosis and Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) can change the way you think about smoking. This therapy has enabled people to stop smoking in one single session and get rid of this debilitating habit, FOREVER!  The best part is, it is a drug-free, painless way of getting rid of a habit without any physical or mentaltrauma associated with quitting.  Quitting smoking or any other habits has never been easier.</p>\n<p><strong>The process in brief</strong></p>\n<ol type="1"><li><strong>Creating Pictures – Building Awareness</strong></li></ol>\n<p>Know that smoking is bad for your health. Be aware of the statistics that shows that smoking causes over 400,000 deaths every year in the US alone, from cancers, chronic lung diseases, and coronary conditions. Cigarette/beedi/weed/tobacco smoking can shorten your life by 14 minutes.  With every smoke, you are 14 minutes closer to your death.</p>\n<p>Picture yourself  finishing one cigarette and a short while later, you are feeling distracted and agitated and you reach for one more – and another – and another. Picture it slowly starting to take a toll on your health – physical and mental. Hear yourself developing a hacking cough, see yellow nicotine stains on your fingers and teeth, see a shaggy swollen face, see the faces of others as they experience the foul smell of your breath, see yourself breathing badly, coughing, feeling chest pain, see the cancer and other diseases attacking and spread through your body and then dying at a young age.</p>\n<p>Have you ever lived a full, successful and happy life? Or has smoking eaten up all your years and then given you death?  What would you prefer?</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Imagine a Smoke Free Life</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Keep making pictures in your mind of how your life could be by giving up smoking. Picture yourself regaining your health, wealth, self-esteem and power. Create a picture of how healthy you feel every day if you were no longer smoking, and inhaling all the deadly poisons into your body. How much younger you would feel, how much fitter, attractive and confident you would be. Imagine your family’s smiling faces when they interact with a healthy you. Imagine the amount of money you would be saving and putting to a better use, on things which would actually improve the quality of your life, and not destroy it.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Using Anchoring Tool in NLP –A ‘Quit Smoking’ timeline</strong></li></ul>\n<p>This is a very effective tool used by NLP experts to help and heal suffocating and deadly habits. Anchoring requires you to create images and sound you would hear given your habit – like wheezing and coughing. Create vivid images of your suffering.  See yourself get weaker and weaker.  See the extent of damage you have caused, feel it to the extent you get repulsed and sick at the sight of yourself.Keep replaying it, making it larger and larger, and more vivid with each imagining.</p>\n<p>Slowly, as the revulsion you feel for yourself, reaches its peak, press the thumb and forefinger of your left hand together and anchor that bad feeling. Repeat the exercise several times. The next time you feel like a smoke and reach for a cigarette, do this exercise – press your thumb and forefinger together. It will revive that feeling of revulsion and you will put the cigarette away.Ensure you keep practicing this technique till the habit leaves you completely free.  The timeline therapy is effective when it practice it.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Draw on your Inner Strength</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Quitting smoking will make you look and feel better and healthier too. The anchoring technique is so strong that, in twenty minutes after you quit, your blood pressure will drop and the temperature of your hands and feet will return to normal. In three to four days, all the accumulated nicotine will leave your body completely.  This will also help your body regain its health.  Because smoking is a habit that is controlled by the unconscious mind, hypnosis and NLP works on developing your inner strength to directly help the unconscious mind to help you effortlessly make that transition into a non-smoker and lead the healthy lifestyle you are meant to lead. There would be challenges along the way but if your decision is to stop smoking, contact an NLP practitioner today and never look back.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

Isn’t it used for mind power and mind control and to enable people to achieve success by changing their negative and limiting script patterns?  Well, you got the answer here – that’s what it exactly does and more where getting fit is concerned, too!</p>\n<p>NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) techniques are suitable for anyone who wants to get fit.  NLP is also beneficial for personal trainers and coaches, who want to bring achievement into whatever they do, which is successfully useNLP techniques with their clients to achieve desired results.</p>\n<ul><li><strong><u>It helps usachieve the right mindset for fitness success</u></strong></li></ul>\n<p>Fitness is not justany physical activity that can be done when one is in a mood to do so. What separates the winners from the rest is their ability to stick to a routine, be consistent in their activities and the way in which they think about fitness. Our brain not only controls all our bodily functions and systems but also plays a pivotal role in our mental and physical wellbeing. It helps us form habits, which is the foundation of any transformation. The habits can be good or bad.  NLP can play a huge role in harnessing the power of our brain and help reset our bad and limiting habitsto achieve an extraordinary lifestyle change, even in the area of fitness.</p>\n<ul><li><strong><u>It helps us understand the “Inner Game” of fitness</u></strong></li></ul>\n<p>The concept of the “inner game” was developed by Timothy Gallwey (1974, 2000) as a way of helping people to achieve excellence in various sports (e.g., tennis, golf, skiing, etc.), music and also in the workplace.It is a known fact that to succeed in life, we should not only have a healthy mind but our body must be healthy,too. Our performance in both professional and personal life depends on how active we are in using our mind as well as our body. If the body is ill, the mind cannot function to its fullest and vice versa. Preparing ourselves mentally to perform well is the essence of our “inner game’, also referred to as the ‘mental approach to fitness’.</p>\n<ul><li><strong><u>It helps us understand the “Outer Game” of fitness</u></strong></li></ul>\n<p>Where the “outer game” is concerned, it is the physical aspects that are monitored. For example, how many calories we must eat in a day, kinds of food we must consume, types of exercises to do and how many repetitions, so on and so forth.  When we understand the inner game of fitness, the outer game becomes much easier to consciously achieve.</p>\n<p>While we require a certain amount of motivation to get into the correct mindset, NLP efforts begin, once a good routine is in place.  To achieve this, NLP sets some directions and learning for us to follow to achieve maximum results. So how do we start?</p>\n<p>Follow the following:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Break Old Habits – </strong>“think before you react.”</li></ul>\n<p>We start with replacing old unhealthy habits with new healthy ones.  If somebody offered you chocolate (which you so obviously like), ask yourself few questions:</p>\n<p>Do I really want this chocolate?</p>\n<p>Will it be healthy for me to have it?</p>\n<p>Do I really need right now?</p>\n<p>If the answer is ‘NO’ refrain from taking it.  In some cases where it becomes absolutely necessary, you can take a very small piece and politely refuse the rest.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Goal Setting is Priority</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Your conscious mind is the part that tells you what you want or will be able to do – money, success in business, better relationship, or whether you will be able to do 50 push-ups. Your conscious mind will be your goal setting partner, so make the most of it</p>\n<ul><li>Set clear and achievable goals</li><li>Break out old habits and set new healthy ones using relevant NLP tools</li><li>Motivation and self-discipline are the keys to success, anytime for anything.  Develop these to help follow through on those goals</li><li>Have an updated self-image and mental maps of self</li><li>Appreciate and acknowledge progress from time to time.  This will help build self-esteem and be a motivator to never give up.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Don’t Stop Once we Start</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Sticking to a fitness routine is like a merry-go-round.  We start with gusto, then with the first temptation, we go back to our old mouldy ways. So basically it becomes a continuous starting, stopping, startingof our fitness goals.</p>\n<p>NLP teaches us how to not give in to this temptation and to reconfigure the way we approach our transformation through awareness and consistency. Whatever obstacles life throws at us, our focus would be on the goals that we have set and the results that we have planned to achieve.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Reframing Inner Resistance</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Once we know what we want, we have to deal with part of our selves that could pose as barriers to successfully reach our goals.  This is another aspect of the “inner game” of fitness. Sometimes it happens that when one part of us wants to achieve set goals, other parts resist or are uncooperative. Many a time, we struggle with the resurfacing of old patterns and habits. NLP teaches us that rather than fighting with ourselves, or getting angry, it is important to acknowledge and communicate with our body and mind.This is a very powerful and effective tool, where when there is a block, we remove the block by having an internal dialogue with ourselves and reframe our script. Reframing is based on the principle of “positive intention.” The principle of positive intention states that at some level, all behavior is (or at one time was) “positively intended.”The reframing process involves understanding and communicating with ourselves, rather than blaming or punishing.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Motivation and Confidence</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Motivation is critical for people to achieve good fitness. As fitness requires a lot of learning, discipline and control, it sometimes can take a toll on us. Many times we find it difficult to keep the momentum going. Sometimes we feel like slacking or procrastinating. During such times, fitness trainers or coaches must help clients discover their own personal “motivators” that/who would keep egging them on. This also applies to individuals who have to find their own motivators to keep going and not give up.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Visualizing Success</strong></li></ul>\n<p>We all like to see what we would achieve after so much of hard work and sacrifice.  Create a compelling future involving visualizing desired goals and successful outcomes. What this does? Such visualizations inspire us to moveforward towards achieving the goal or outcome. It is also a source of motivation, helping us to create a positive expectation and propelling us to move forward to achieve it. Remember the good feelings that come from picturing ourselves reaching our goals by doing the exercises and eating the way that we know will help us move closer to our fitness goals. Being fit is the key to both personal and professional abundance. The benefits of being fit is having increased energy, vitality, strength and flexibility, which allows better concentration, more stamina and greater readiness to meet life’s challenges. Good fitness greatly reduces the risk of a variety of illnesses and physical problems and allows us to lead a long, happy and healthy life. Who wouldn’t want this?Get fit, the NLP way. Stay healthy, stay happy.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

All of these sentences rise out of fear and fear gives rise to such limiting beliefs.</p>\n<p><strong><em>“Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one’s courage.”</em></strong></p>\n<p>— Anais Nin</p>\n<p>Fear sabotages success. When fear is what rules us, our behavior and attitude towards life and success changes.  We create a number of mental blocks which prevents us from taking up anything new or meeting challenges. We live in ‘hesitation’ mode.</p>\n<p>Fear is a very powerful emotion. It strongly effects on our mind and body. Fear can create strong signals of response when we’re in emergencies – for instance, if we are caught in a fire or are being attacked. This natural response is very important for survival. But when fear takes effect when we face non-dangerous events, like exams, public speaking, a new job, a date, or even a party, it becomes rather a bane than a boon. It cripples us.</p>\n<p>When fear becomes a natural response to a threat that is only perceived, it becomes a killer.  A killer of dreams, abilities, confidence and growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Why do we fear?  Is fear necessary?</strong></p>\n<p>Healthy fear is necessary. If we wouldn’t be afraid at all, we wouldn’t have survived for long.  To survive, it is very important to know what to fear.  Else, we would be involved in one disaster after the other.  We wouldn’t be alive at all. We’d be handling wild animals, walking into oncoming traffic, jumping down a steep incline, or dealing with dangerous people. All of which is dangerous. We do not because we know we must fear them, else we won’t survive.</p>\n<p>Since the evolution of mankind, fear is an instinct that has helped man overcome and deal with dangers and perils in order to survive.  But when these fears seep into other areas where the threats are only perceived, it cripples us. It stops our growth and does not allow us to lead the life we otherwise should have. These fears stop us from exploring any area of our development, be it communication, personal development, professional development, social development, and so on.  We find it difficult to speak, sing or perform in public, have no confidence whatsoever to give that interview or try for that promotion. It makes us miss so many opportunities in life where we refuse to take action. Well said by Ralph Waldo Emerson “Fear defeats more people than any other one thing in the world.”</p>\n<p><strong>NLP Techniques to overcome Fear and Limiting Beliefs.</strong></p>\n<p>There is nothing more effective in helping us take action and do away with non-existent fears than NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) techniques.</p>\n<p>The feeling of fear is in the mind.  NLP techniques help us to understand healthy and unhealthy fears. It works on unhealthy fears and helps eradicate them from our lives and replaces it with courage and foresight. NLP techniques are so useful it makes us realise that we have it all within us. It helps uproot our self-doubt, and stops us from negating ourselves and our potential. It takes us from the feeling or hesitation of “I’m not quite feeling my best right now. I will think about doing it” to “ I will do it right away”. From in-action to action.  It givesus the breakthrough that we could have been looking for all through our lives.<strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Few NLP Techniques to Break Through Fear and Limiting Beliefs</strong></p>\n<p>Most adults have dozens of fears, both rational and irrational. Fears get installed into our ‘programming’ by various external and internal factors. Our surroundings, culture, upbringing, parenting, teachers, friends, social dos and donts, experiences, and so on.  We perceive everything that happens around us through our five senses, and this becomes part of our behavior.</p>\n<p>For example, how do we develop fears and phobias?  It is due to incidents in our past that have enabled this fear. For example – fear of being in the dark.  When we were kids, our parents or an elder would tell us stories about dark rooms and boogey men, how children would be punished if they didn’t behave, by putting them in the dark room. This triggers the child’s fear response. If I don’t behave I will be put into the dark room and dark rooms have full of dangers lurking in there.  Later on, in life he has no idea wherehis fear of the dark has come from. That’s programming.</p>\n<p>Fear isn’t bad, but being controlled by fear is. NLP processes help participants identify and overcome their irrational fears by enabling them with learning and practicing skills, to first gain confidence. With confidence comes trust that they will be able to take control of their fears and channelize it productively. Then NLP uses more in-depth techniques to dismantle the deeply held fears. Let us understand few of these techniques which help us get past our deeply held irrational fears.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Identify the Fears- Awareness</strong></p>\n<p>Fear is also a habit. To change a habit, we need to first identify it. NLP helps us identify rational and irrational fears.  If we want to work on our irrational fears and take them out of our lives, we first go through the process of knowing them. Take a few deep breaths. Then being in the present moment, start prioritizing awareness by being rooted to the sensations of the body. Be aware of whatever you are going through in the process.</p>\n<p>Being rooted and aware, helps us examine our mental and emotional states of happiness, sadness, anxiety, fear, and so on and incidents that triggered these states. There would be many things happening inside us during this process, but focus and bring attention to the emotion, fear, so that we can  examine it deeply and get to its root.  Currently we are only in the awareness state.  We have to take it gradually – one step at a time.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What triggers this fear – recognize triggers</strong></p>\n<p>The next step is to shift our awareness to the events that could have triggered our fears.  Here we go into our past to get to the root of this fear.</p>\n<p>What could have been the trigger or triggers?If, for example, my fear is speaking in public, then people laughing at me when I participated in a public forum could have been the trigger for me to avoid public speaking. Even the word – public speaking – is enough to trigger a negative reaction, a recoil, that even though I have the knowledge and expertise required to speak and share my thoughts, wild horses couldn’t drag me to speak in public.</p>\n<p>Now with NLP tools and strategies at my disposal, I can face this fear and question it to come up with answers as to whether my fear is justified.  Should it even be there?  I am no more the person I was as a child. Then why has the fear grown along with me?  Is it needed anymore? How can I change my behavior to enable me to get rid of this fear? Questioning ourselves will give us the answers we are looking for and help increase our confidence in ourselves.</p>\n<p>We start realizing our patterns.  Now comes the time to choose actions that are appropriate.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Break disabling Patterns</strong></p>\n<p>One must first understand that our fears and phobias or limiting beliefs are only reactions to stimuli. Once we understand our pattern of thoughts and reactions, we are in a position to change our reactions and implement newer and more efficient ones, that will be beneficial for us. But first we have to break the disabling pattern.</p>\n<p>It can be done by taking slow deep breaths. Inhale, exhale and be aware of how we breathe. Free the mind. Get into a relaxed state. Our aim is to change how we view the triggers that enable our fear. Now it’s time to change our reaction to the trigger from a conscious state. Enable a new reaction but this time a positive one, consciously. By changing our mindset, we can change our reaction to stimuli and bring profound meaning and success to our lives. </p>\n<p>These techniques are just the tip of the ice-berg.  NLP tools and strategies deploy many such methods that can uproot any fears and limiting beliefs from our conscious/sub-conscious and replace them with powerful and enabling beliefs to allow us the freedom to live the life we deserve, make the choices that would only take us forward towards success.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

There’s only one moment for us to live, and that is the present moment – so live in the present moment, wisely and earnestly” ………..Buddha</p>\n<p>Right from childhood to whatever age we are in today, we face various situations and circumstances that leave a mark on the way we behave, think, trust, communicate and interact. If most of the occasions are positive ones, we carry less baggage and are able to move through life with a flow that a person, less privileged,would envy. But, if the occasions have left a negative impact on our lives, consciously or unconsciously, then our lives get into a different tangent than the one we should rightfully be experiencing and enjoying.  This happens to many, because more often than not, people have a tendency to live in the past – a good percentage of them.</p>\n<p><strong>What do people live in the past?</strong></p>\n<p>There is a difference between thinking about the past and living in it. Reminiscing about the ‘good old days’ isn’t a bad thing.  We all like to go back and think and remember many good or not so good incidents that happened.  It’s familiar and we know what happened, and many times it brings a smile to our faces and makes us feel warm and good. </p>\n<p>When it becomes a case of living in the past or always escaping into past thoughts, which puts a shadow on present and future achievements, it becomes unhealthy and can have many negative consequences. </p>\n<p>Find out if you are living in the past? Ask yourself these few questions:</p>\n<ol type="1"><li>Does thinking about your past make you feel sad?</li><li>Are you afraid of what your future might hold?</li><li>Do you feel you are at a crossroad or stagnant in life which makes you feel frustrated?</li><li>Do you cling to any particular period of your past when you were happy, energetic and successful?</li><li>Do you feel that you will never reach that level of happiness, energy and success again?</li></ol>\n<p>The past is gone and there isn’t much we can do about it, yet we spend considerable amount of time thinking of the past, and often wish things could have been different and better. Of course, we have our reasons. For some, thinking about past happy events gives a sense of comfort whereas for others it is reliving some suffering that still causes emotional distress.</p>\n<p>If we are ready to experience what life has to offer and make our life successful and meaningful, then whatever happened in the past, we can always decide to make the change, welcome and allow the process that will help to make this change into our lives, so that we can live a life that we deserve and cherish.</p>\n<p><strong>Let go of your past using NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) techniques</strong></p>\n<p>NLP shows you HOW to let go of past traumas using a simple, but Powerful Technique, to remove unwanted past memories and move purposefully and confidently into the future</p>\n<p><strong><em>“We are free, but are we, if we are prisoners of our own minds”…….</em></strong><strong><em>Nimeno Prosper</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p>\n<p>Carrying the baggage of unwanted past memories will only weigh heavier and heavier if there is no closure.  The longer you carry something, the heavier it weighs you down. We link a number of past memories which become our identities, carry it around like medals, without understanding the harm it is causing us.</p>\n<p>The Time and Timeline Therapy techniqueis a powerful NLP technique used by Master Practitioners to help peopleget rid of life’s baggage and create a positive change in their lives. Timelining is also known as “Rewriting your core story”technique.</p>\n<p><strong><u>NLP – Time and Timeline Therapy process in brief</u></strong></p>\n<p>1. Make a list of all of significant events in your life (significant to you).</p>\n<p>2. Write how they are all linked – what do each of these events mean/say about you?</p>\n<p>3.  Write out how the said events defined you as a person?</p>\n<p>3. Capture the “core story” running through each of these events?</p>\n<p>4. Core Stories have a tendency to keep showing up at various points in our lives. Check how does the core story show up even today?</p>\n<p><strong>     Note:</strong> Give thanks to the core story/stories for what it has bought into your life. Honor it and experience that it is valuable, accept and acknowledge what it has prevented you from being/doing, and what it has cost you.</p>\n<p>5. Keep theimportant components of your core story aside, safe in the knowledge that you will still have the power to choose these behaviors and experiences even after this technique is done</p>\n<p>6. Now you only have the un-resourceful residue of the Core Story remaining.  Now it’s time to eradicate and META NO your core story and it’s limiting definition of you.</p>\n<p>7. Using NLP skills knowledge and access which can be gained from relevant training and coaching, amplify and apply your most powerful state of eradication/disconfirmation, your META NO, to the core story, by asking yourself these questions:</p>\n<ul><li>Does this core story bring out your absolute best?</li><li>Does it add value to your life and make it enjoyable?</li><li>Does it enable you to live out your full potential in the present?</li></ul>\n<p>8. As you apply your META NO to your core story, representationally let it go. To give you a more complete feeling, scrunch up what you have written down and throw it into the fire.  Watching the flames engulf the ball of paper visibly,gives a surge of power and instills a sense of confidence that things are going to be better.</p>\n<p>10. If you are ready then, rewrite your life script and welcome in (META YES) new and more resourceful meanings of your own choosing about the events of the past.</p>\n<p>Complete this technique and your representations of the past are free to disappear like smoke into the sky. It is very important to let go of long held negative emotions and self-sabotaging behaviors. Re-energize your emotional intelligence and vitality and move forward, overcoming any possible blocks that might get in your way.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

People have started to\nunderstand the value that positive affirmations bring into lives and slowly\nthis trend has become a part of mainstream success culture and way of living.</p>\n<p>Affirmations\nare all about learning to win the mind game. \nThe crux here is, wanting to create the change in our lives. To make it\nbetter, to achieve all that we have set out to achieve. What stops us and has\nalways stopped us – we ourselves! How? By allowing a scarcity mindset, our past\nexperiences, limiting beliefs, conscious and sub-conscious conditioning, to\ncontrol our minds,and will keep telling us we cannot do it. It never shuts up. Wemight\ntell ourselves – ‘I will be successful’;our sub-conscious will slowly peep out\nand say, ‘Are you sure? But, you failed miserably last time.  Do you have it in you?’. What we have to\nremember here is, these beliefs have been slowly and gradually built up by ourselves,\nour parents, people and circumstances in our lives and thus we have formed\nopinions about ourselves that will not be very easy to overcome until we are\nguided to change our limiting beliefs and replace it with empowering ones.</p>\n<p>Our\npowerful inner voice is so conditioned to swerve into the negative, that though\nwe want to be motivated and energized to achieve success, our self-talk\nautomatically and un-consciously turns negative. It is an un-wanted inner radar\nthat keeps pointing out to all our fears, insecurities, and general feelings of\ninadequacy and unworthiness. This kind of negative self-talk is so strong and\npowerful that we prefer to believe it and give up.  </p>\n<p>NLP\nstrategies and tools shows us that this self-talk is not the complete truth and\nwe have to stop believing everything it says. NLP enables us with the knowledge\nand understanding that most of these self-talks are inaccurate, exaggerated,\nand self-destructive.</p>\n<p>Needless\nto say, our inner voice is not always wrong.  Since it speaks from both conscious thoughts\nand subconscious beliefs, itis actually very helpful when it comes to reminding\nus of some circumstance or task that need our attention, more to do with tasks\nthat we consciously want to carry out and is an effective way for the brain to\ninterpret and process daily experiences. \nIt is also useful when the thoughts are positive, talking down our fears,\nthus bolstering our confidence at various instances.</p>\n<p>NLP\nlearning show us the way here. How to use affirmations in the right manner\nusing powerful words, develop a winning mindset and ensure the affirmations getsus\nresults. </p>\n<p>Coming\nback to positive self-affirmations – we can also call it success affirmations –\n because that is what we all want, we\nmust learn how to first do away with the biggest obstacle that we have to face,\nright inside our heads – our negative self-talk.  NLP helps you build this awareness about its\nsabotaging behavior and can help reprogram our minds with positive and success\nbehavior using various tools. One of them is positive affirmations for success.\nThese affirmations must bedone consistently and properly to fetch the desired\nresults. The words in the affirmations are so powerful, that it can prevent us\nfrom thinking in the nеgаtіvе and prevent us from sabotaging ourselveswith\nlimiting beliefs.</p>\n<p><strong>Self-affirmations for Success – The HOW</strong></p>\n<p>It\nis simple enough – when you are saying the words, say it in present tense, and say\nit in a manner that what you are affirming is already true and in existence. The\nwords we use are very important.  Using\nthe wrong words can negate the results leaving us feeling confused and\ndefeated.</p>\n<p>For\nexample – In order to attract good health, if we keep saying – ‘<em>I am not sick’</em>! (This is not a positive\naffirmation.  The ‘not’ brings negativity\nto the affirmation, thus disabling it from giving us the desired results.   Our sub-conscious, which already has a\nrepertoire of negating beliefs, registers the ‘not’ in the sentence and picks\nup the negativity. NLP would teach you to say it like this; ‘<em>I am healthy in body, mind and spirit</em>’\nor ‘<em>Mу bоdу іѕ healthy; mу mind іѕ\nbrilliant; my soul is at peace’.  It is\nlike you are giving permission to yourself and the Universe to make it so and it\nresponds accordingly.</em></p>\n<p>Instead\nof saying; ‘<em>For me nothing is impossible’</em>,\nwecan say;‘I believe, I саn achieve anything I desire’.</p>\n<p><strong>Some Positive Affirmations that can add\nvalue to our lives and bring us back to power:(</strong>self-help-and-self-development\nsuccess affirmations<strong>)</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Everything that is\nhappening now, is happening for my ultimate good.</li><li>I recognize every new\nchallenge as an opportunity.</li><li>I am a success magnet\nandI attract success in whatever I do.</li><li>Being successful is\nmy natural stateof being. I think only of success.</li><li>All my actions are aimed\nat reaching my goals. I achieve my goals one<br/>\nafter the other.</li><li>I always spot\nopportunities andutilize them. New doors arealways opening for me.</li><li>I am in charge of my\nlife. I always take the correct decision and that decision always leads to\nsuccess.</li><li>The power is within\nme. I learnfrom the past, live in the now andplan for the future.</li><li>I realize that\nsuccess is a result of right thinking and hard work.I excel in both.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Some extra tips to help us manifest our\naffirmations and journey towards success</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Get Used to it.</strong></p>\n<p>Affirmations\nwill take some time getting into the practice. Start small – maybe 1 or 2\naffirmations like – ‘I enjoy doing my work. It gives me pleasure’.  Even repeating this, two or three times, will\nhelp us see our work witha new perspective. \nManifesting affirmations will take some time getting used to.</p>\n<p><strong>Keep Repeating it every Day</strong></p>\n<p>An\naction becomes a habit when it is done every day. When we keep doing something\nevery day, we become better at it. The more we say it every day, the more it\nactualizes.  It’s said that a habit takes\ntwenty-one days to catch on.  Repeat\naffirmations daily. Things start to change around us thus leading us to our\ndesired experience.</p>\n<p><strong>BELIEVE that it will happen!</strong></p>\n<p>We\nmust believe, believe and believe that we are worthy of receiving what we\ndesire. It may sometimes feel like we are not telling ourselves the truth since\naffirmations are all about what we have not seen yet, about what we will receive\nin the future, disbelief could set in. Decide to feel worthy of receiving, and\nfocus on it, starting right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Supporting our Affirmations</strong></p>\n<p>We\nmust start living the success that we are affirming for, by surrounding\nourselveswith people, places, experiences and lifestyle in alignment with our\ndesires.This is like inviting, welcoming and accepting into our lives,what we\nare going to receive through our affirmations.</p>\n<p>When\nwe support our affirmations, it may come easier than we think. We must\nrecognize opportunities and take necessary actions. Things\nfall into place, the right people and opportunities will show up, to help us\nprogress towards it. </p>\n<p>Success is an inner mind game. It is all about taming the mind to achieve what we want to achieve.  If we see ourselves as someone who achieves, we become that person. Theonly stumbling block that could stop us here would be ourselves and our limiting beliefs. One exercise that will help nullify the power and effect our limiting beliefs have on us can be, we саn rеmоvе and rеvоkе аll реrmіѕѕіоns  thаt we have соnѕсіоuѕlу or unсоnѕсіоuѕlу given, tо аll thе іllѕ and failures оf thе wоrld,  bесаuѕе then we ѕhаrе thаt раіn, and thus become a part of it.  When this is done we consciously, and subconsciously are better able to fill ourselves with more enabling thoughts and beliefs which will help us achieve whatever our mind sets out to achieve. It’s all in the mind; it’s all about the mind.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

The negative aspect is, if the habit is a destructive one, the impact\nand end results can be quite drastic.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>The\neyes see only what the mind is prepared to comprehend – Henri Bergson</em></strong></p>\n<p>So\nwhy not help the eyes and mind with winning habits that would go a long way in\nenabling success?  From childhood to\nadulthood, our neural pathways will have been cultivated with various behaviors.\nSome of these are enabling, whereas some may be limiting. We don’t know the\norigin of these behaviors.  Various\nincidents could have triggered certain behaviors, nor do we know the precise\nnature of its mechanisms. What we should delve upon here is, whether the\nbehaviors we have accumulated are the ones that would make us successful in\nlife or are they limiting us?</p>\n<p>One\nway and clearly the most effective way to do this is through the synergy of\nhypnosis and NLP brought together. Hypnosis can help to break limitingbehaviors\nby working on your beliefs and helping them to change.  As your behavior is governed by your habits,\nNLP has techniques that canchange these habits which reside deep in the brain’s\nneuro-psychology and neuro-pathology and replace it with enabling habits or\nalternate enabling behaviors.  But a word\nof caution: success is only enabled when the new enabling behaviors are\nconverted into habits, else it’s quite likely that your first notion will be to\nfall back into old ways the minute you feel challenged. How and why does this\nhappen? After this particular activity is conducted, there is always a\nhoneymoon period when the participants experience new behaviors and ideas and\nuse it for the first time. Because of their enabled behaviors there is a surge\nof positive responses from the world around which can give the participant a\nhigh giving him a feeling that the situation will always remain the same. At\nany point they encountersomedifficulty or a challenging situation, they could\nfall back into their old ways. In such times, you need to see the situation\nbroadly.Pace yourself and don’t be rushed into doing just anything.  Anyone who is able to do this, can get past the\nhurdles and pull success into theirlives.</p>\n<p><strong>What is Hypnosis?</strong></p>\n<p>Hypnosis\nis a human condition involving focused attention, reduced peripheral awareness,\nand an enhanced capacity to respond to suggestion.  During hypnosis, a person is said to have\nheightened focus and concentration and an increased response to suggestions. Hypnosis\nusually begins with a hypnotic induction involving a series of preliminary\ninstructions and suggestion. Hypnotism was normally used for therapeutic\npurposes, like pain management, trauma management and was referred to as\n“hypnotherapy”, while its use as a form of entertainment for an\naudience is known as “stage hypnosis”. </p>\n<p>Having\nexperienced the success of Hypnosis in various treatments and how people have\nresponded to suggestions, it is now being used to not only treat but also to\nchange mindsets in order to enable people to live a more fulfilled lives.  </p>\n<p><strong>What is Self Hypnosis?</strong></p>\n<p>Self-hypnosis is a process of a\nself-induced hypnotic state.  Here, the\nsubject “plays the dual role of suggester and suggestee”.  The nature of the auto-suggestive practice\nmay be, at one extreme, “concentrative”, wherein “all attention\nis so totally focus on the words of the auto-suggestive formula, e.g. ‘Every\nday, I am becoming more and more successful’ that everything else is kept out\nof awareness and, at the other, “inclusive”, wherein subjects\n“allow all kinds of thoughts, emotions, memories, and the like to drift\ninto their consciousness. Getting into an extreme meditative state is one form\nof self-hypnosis.</p>\n<p><strong>What is NLP?</strong></p>\n<p>NLP\nis a science of understanding how people organize or map their thinking,\nfeeling, language and behavior to produce the results they do. NLP provides\npeople with a methodology to model outstanding performances achieved by successful\npeople and use it intheir personal development and for success in business. A\nkey element of NLP is that we form our unique internal mental maps of everything\naround us, filter and perceive information absorbed through our five senses,\nand form opinions and behaviors around it, based on the information we have. Neuro-Linguistic\nProgramming tools can help filter, reveal and instill the kind of communication\nthat matters most – on the inside and out.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits of this SYNERGY?</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Install in\nyour mind new beliefs and enabling behaviors</li><li>Helps get\nrid of disabling behaviors and habits</li><li>Helpprepare\nyourself with a positive coping strategy for times you encounter something\ncomplex</li><li>Creates a\nplatform for healthy relationships</li><li>Creates\naccountability for yourself, your actions and to your work</li><li>Creates transformation,\nfrom a confused person to an extremely confident and successful one</li><li>Elevates\nself-image while lowering stress, anger, anxiety and fear</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Deeper benefits</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Gives you a\nwhole new personality, communication abilities and confidence that make people sit\nup and take notice.</li><li>Removes trauma\nand other blocks from your past without or with minimal re-experience of the\ncause</li><li>Helps you\nget unstuck by removing fear and uncomfortable feelings associated with\nachieving the happiness you deserve. </li><li>Become more\naware of your unconscious mind and learn how to speak directly to another person’s\nunconscious mind using embedded commands</li></ul>\n<p>Use ofthis combination therapy, can help people remove unwanted emotions and restraining beliefs about themselves.

This is incredibly powerful because many fears and anxieties are reinforced throughout a person’s life.

These therapies are used by influential people, worldwide and is the reason that has enabled a success attitude in many.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

Each of us we have a set routine that we do every day. How do we know what we should do at that particular time each day? What is it that guides us towards remembering and doing it? This is our unconscious mind at work. Our unconscious mind can guide us right through routine decisions. It works like programming.</p>\n<p>We feed in a particular routine, consciously follow it through for a couple of days or more and then the unconscious mind takes over and follows it day in and day out without consciously realizing what’s going on. And yes, we do it very well, many times with clockwork precision. It is like we have put our life on ‘auto-pilot’, which efficiently does our routine without having to stop, think, decide.</p>\n<p>But all decisions and tasks are not routine, isn’t it. While many small and routine decisions are made by the unconscious mind, many of the  decisions have to be thought of well and consciously taken. The ability  to make a conscious decision is one of the things that separate human  beings from any other living being. Making choices and decisions all the  time are part and parcel of human lives – some are made consciously  whilst others unconsciously. Some decisions are rational; whilst others, could be emotional. Some are right decisions, whilst others could lead to trouble.</p>\n<p>As human beings, we all want to make correct and conscious decisions.  We all want to be excellent in making decisions but many a time we fail to do so. Conscious decision making requires knowledge,  understanding, evaluation and the correct mind-set to make them. To achieve this state, it is important for us to know the ‘HOW TO DO IT’.</p>\n<p>One of the methods and a very powerful one is through using NLP Techniques. NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) is a science which  helps build confidence and improve the quality of life on a day to day  basis. The crux of NLP teaching is you learn the correct way to handle life situations by taking the right decisions which will steer your life in the direction that is meant for you.</p>\n<p>Although unconscious decision making is integral and important for human life to take its course, (because having everyday auto pilot habits are also very important, else if we had only conscious decisions to make, life would be a huge big chaos), conscious decisions making is what helps you control your mind in a way that helps you achieve your goals and helps you rise to new, achievable heights. But the sad part is, our conscious decisions many times lead us to trouble, doubt and disappointment.</p>\n<p>How can NLP make us become confident in our conscious Decision Making?</p>\n<p> Bringing about positive changes in our mind can trigger positive outcomes. NLP strategies help rewire our minds to behave in a certain way, take control of our life and life decisions by finding solutions from within. Few techniques used in NLP to help in this journey of making informed and conscious decisions which are measurable and can definitely be noticed are as follows:</p>\n<p>Anchoring: Consciously creating anchors in trigger situations to achieve target states</p>\n<p>Future Pacing: Visualizing a decision, its impact in the future and  then monitoring reactions</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Swish:</strong> Disrupting the pattern of thought from unwanted behavior to desired behavior</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong> Reframing</strong>: Changing an undesirable behavior, thought process or trait into a positive intention</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Well-formed Outcome</strong>: This process allows us to go into the actual “programming” of our minds to drive us toward our desired decisions and outcomes</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Ecology</strong>: Checking the desired decisions and outcomes from all angles of life and relationships – 360% check</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Covert Hypnosis</strong>: Communicating with another person’s unconscious mind to persuade them to behave or think a certain way</li></ul>\n<p>Some decisions, if taken right, can change our lives forever. These decisions many times are tough to make, but if we have the courage and confidence to follow through, we open ourselves to a fulfilling path filled with numerous possibilities and revel in the chance to create the life we want to live.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

It’s about turning these ideas into reality and nurturing the same towards success, come what may.</em></strong></p></p>\n<p>Entrepreneurship process begins with a business idea and the courage to put that idea into action. It is about designing, launching and running a new  business, by taking on financial risks with the hope of making a profit.</p>\n<p>Entrepreneurship, more often than not, starts as a small venture, either as a proprietary business or partnership business. The people who start these businesses are called entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p> To be an entrepreneur, one has to understand and accept what comes with  it in the form of challenges, ambiguity, dis-comfort. Entrepreneurs are challenged regularly, especially when it comes to raising capital for their business and getting new clients. An entrepreneur has to be ready for failures, pressures, and irrational demands of the business, even to the extent of wanting to give up because sometimes the odds of succeeding are dismal. What works for them and makes them successful is their unshake able belief in their dreams, unwavering focus on delivering value and their persistence.</p>\n<p> Entrepreneurs, their business is their baby. They would test their limits;<br/> leave no stone unturned to ensure that they are successful. Using their  inherent intelligence, drive and hard work, entrepreneurs have contributed to national economies, industries, and markets in a large way. They drive  innovations, have invented and developed new products, shaped organizations, and have brought in an influx of new technologies. Monopoly is nearly extinct now. Entrepreneurs are the shapers of the new world. They have forced the world to sit up and take notice, with innovations that have transformed society.</p>\n<p>Their journey is not easy. Successes, failures, keeping up with various demands of the business, can take a toll on the entrepreneur if not handled in the right manner and mindset. Sometimes various challenges which come along can push through thought processes, thus creating limiting beliefs and other mental roadblocks which prevent entrepreneurs from achieving their full potential.</p>\n<p>To achieve and retain consistent success it is important to have the right mindset to do business. It is important and imperative to have the right tools to aid this progression. NLP (Neuro-linguistic Programming), is one such tool which can help us consciously take greater control of our lives and accomplish our goals. NLP tools have the abilities to help entrepreneurs remain calm during tough situations, achieve personal and business mastery, develop or enhance leadership abilities, improve communication thus improving business positions. The strength of NLP is that it help  people tap into their own internal resources. It re-programs the  mind into behaving in a manner which enables the person to excel personally and professionally. It helps in boosting confidence, enhances self-power and gives us the ability to achieve our goals.</p>\n<p>Let’s explore few ways NLP can help achievements in Entrepreneurs:</p>\n<ol><li><strong>Helps manage Thoughts and Feelings:</strong></li></ol>\n<p>With a focus on creating the right impact, whatever the situation may  be, whether it is dealing with clients, managing employees,  negotiating a prestigious contract, an entrepreneur must manage his  thoughts and feelings appropriately and focus on keeping his  thoughts positive. Our thoughts can have a great impact on the way  we behave. An Entrepreneur is required to be at his best in any of the above situations. </p>\n<p>NLP techniques will help you strike the right chord with the people you are dealing with. It will make your thoughts positive and communication and conversations effective. It is a known fact that when the leader thinks and talks positively, the organization and its employees absorb the positivity and performs better. They are motivated and work to give their best. Same with clients. Everyone likes a positive confident, purposeful and trustful person to do  business with.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Helps Communicate Effectively:</strong></p>\n<p>Communication is the backbone of an organization. Since effective communication is vital for every business, using powerful NLP techniques to get your thoughts across to the others will change the way people think about you. Effective communication is a powerful strategy for successful entrepreneurship.  Not only will powerful communication techniques help entrepreneurs  get new clients, it also builds lasting relationships and helps in the  success of the business. For an entrepreneur, this is a great advantage as NLP techniques can help you communicate effectively with yourself (motivation, right mindset, eliminating limiting thoughts, etc.) and with others to bring about business growth. </p>\n<p><strong>3. Builds Confidence:</strong></p>\n<p>Confidence is the key to success. A confident entrepreneur finds it easier to explore new strategies and look for new opportunities for  their business. Their confidence reflects in their persona and the  persona of the business. Although entrepreneurship can take a toll on many, and  entrepreneurs can get bogged down by negative thoughts, bad experience or unsuccessful attempts, if they have confidence as their ally, nothing or no one can stop them from achieving success. It is therefore imperative that they replace the negative thoughts with positive ones. NLP uses strategies that will help them use their bad experiences to turn them into stepping stones for successes. Not just this, NLP strategies and tools are designed to Improve Focus, look  for opportunities and meet challenges in the right manner. </p>\n\n<p>NLP will train  the mind to look for opportunities, instead of getting pulled down by hindrances. Since Entrepreneurship is a dynamic concept, it requires the adaptability and flexibility to embrace positive changes and deal with negative ones. One very inspiring example would be of when Biz Stone, co-founder of Twitter, had failed in his first start-up company, Xanga.<br/>Instead of losing hope, he decided to start all over again from scratch. He adapted himself to the situations and worked his way up once again till he got a job at Google and later became the brains behind one of the most  popular social media platforms used by us – Twitter.</p>\n<p>An Entrepreneurs job is not easy. Successes don’t come easily and when  they do it is a job to retain it, consistently. At the initial stages of an entrepreneur’s life, getting success is like looking for a needle in a haystack. But with NLP creating the right mindset for you, the goals become achievable. Even at times when things look grey, the entrepreneur is so equipped with the necessary tools that dealing with the situation becomes a part of the ride. NLP and Entrepreneurship is all about behavior  flexibility.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

How? This would be a question many a person who do not know or is not introduced to this science would ask.</p></p>\n<p>It is nothing but the truth that knowledge of the tools of NLP and how to use these tools to our advantage is a powerful, in business and in one’s life. One of the key uses would be to gain influence over other people, be it clients, vendors, peers, subordinates, in marketing, in sales, during meetings and so on. But first we have to influence ourselves.</p>\n<p>Let me ask you few questions:</p>\n<ul><li>What if you could communicate in a way that enabled you to easily get your message across to people, at all different levels, of an organization?</li></ul>\n<ul><li>  What if you could motivate someone to do something the way  you want it to be, just by your use of specific language patterns?</li></ul>\n<ul><li> What if you could help people overcome their problems in order to make them more efficient and productive?</li></ul>\n<p>What if you were able to influence customer choices by communicating with them at an unconscious level so that they  just get a good feeling about your product or service and accept your suggestions?</p>\n<p>Difficult to believe, isn’t it? But, not impossible. NLP can help you do all of this. In this article we will know more about one technique that can  be adopted to increase your confidence, power, and mental strength. </p>\n<p>NLP practitioners use this as part of their tools and techniques in their coaching workshops, enabling people to rise to their full potential.</p>\n<p>Everyone wants to be successful. But the road to success, as the saying goes, is littered with thorns, road-blocks and anything that would challenge any persons’ patience and capability. But, if a person is prepared and equipped with the understanding, tools and techniques, they are capable to make their way through all this clutter, and come out a winner</p>\n<p>From childhood we have our dreams. We want to achieve this and that, become something in life. Whatever a person wants to be, the end result is, they want to be successful. Everyone loves success,  because it is success that can bring joy and abundance into our lives.  This pattern that we are going to know today is about fulfilling dreams.  Just having dreams and aspirations is not enough. You must know how  to decode it, map it to your thinking and behaving patterns and visualize it. It is important to understand that often the reason we don’t feel confident, powerful, or strong, is because we imagine that we are not good enough.</p>\n<p> We are afraid of failures. That is the message we are giving our brain. The brain cannot tell the difference between imagination and experiencing. For instance, if you keep thinking negative about an outcome of a meeting that you are having the next day, the outcome will be negative because that is what you have been telling your brain all the time. That’s the conversation you have been having with your brain, and brain only understands communication. This same method can be used to bring about positive results.</p>\n<p>This method is exactly how the <strong>Hologram Pattern</strong> works.</p>\n<p>In this pattern you create a hologram of the “You” that is successful, the person you want to become. Successful, Confident, Powerful, Wealthy.</p>\n<p>Imagine what you would look like? Make a hologram of yourself, make it larger than life and look at it. What you see in your Hologram, the feelings and expressions, body language would be displayed non- verbally in your body language, facial expressions, and voice and so on. We all have our role models, especially the successful ones. We want to one day be in their shoes. The Hologram method allows us to transform ourselves into that role model and adopt all of its qualities. Which means we want to transform ourselves into the Hologram we see of ourselves. The Hologram we create of our self becomes our reality. This NLP technique can easily be used with adults as well as children.</p>\n<p>The ‘Hologram Method’ helps in transforming our relationship with ourselves and with others. The possibilities that NLP tools and techniques offer, if used in the right manner, is endless. It acts as a catalyst in helping us achieve our goals and fulfilling our dreams. Nothing is IMPOSSIBLE.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

In the process we are always racing against time and forget to look where we should have in the first place – within us! </p>\n<p>Human Beings have so much hidden potential within them. Research say, many of us use only a small fraction (about 2-3%) of this infinite resource throughout our lives. Some of us have uncovered such astonishing discoveries and inventions, but a majority, still have a long way to go. Sometimes we are not able to achieve our goals even till we reach old age, which leaves us feeling unfulfilled and disillusioned.</p>\n<p>There are so many case studies and examples where people have  achieved what they have set out to do. Many of them have done this  with a profound knowledge about the power within they possess and of  course unrelenting hard work. They live in a world where whatever  they think, they create; and whatever they desire, they achieve.  Obstacles are not part of their agenda. For them it is a world filled with  opportunities for success. Hence such people live a full life. They enjoy  good health, great wealth, prosperity and successes. They are achievers. They are powerful in all areas of their lives, be it physical,  emotional, financial or spiritual.</p>\n<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conditioning your mind for this kind of success using NLP (Neuro<br/>Linguistic Programming).</span></strong></p>\n<p>Sounds too good to be true, doesn’t it. But the fact is, IT IS TRUE! The mind of a Human Being is so powerful that it can achieve anything one wants in life, with the right direction and relentless doing.</p>\n<p>So how can NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) help? To know this we have to first know our minds a little more.</p>\n<p>Our superior mind is divided into two parts, the objective mind or the conscious mind and the subjective mind or the sub-conscious mind. Sub-conscious mind occupies 90% of your mind while the conscious one occupies only 10%. Each of these minds have an agenda of their own and play their roles well independently, and together when need arises.</p>\n<p>The objective mind is external which in this context means unbiased and projects balanced facts about something and is not influenced by past experiences, prejudices, perceptions, desires or knowledge of the person or situation. The information given by the objective mind is entirely based on facts, is observable, quantifiable and provable, all which proves helpful in rational decision making.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the subjective mind is dominated by the personal feelings, opinion and preferences of the person. The outcome generated by the subjective mind need not always be the complete truth, but is more often a self-interpretation of truth or reality, from the person’s angle. Such information or decisions are often biased and influenced by surroundings, assumptions and past experiences.The objective mind is quantifiable. It does the thinking. The doing is done by the subjective mind. The subjective mind is amenable to suggestions. Hence it is also amenable to suggestions from the objective mind. Now you see where I am getting to. If the objective mind gives the suggestion that ‘I am successful’ to the subjective mind, the subjective mind internalizes it, accepts the suggestion and acts on it. It starts believing it and fulfills the belief.</p>\n<p>Your mindset is a strong factor in achieving any type of success. One can create the right mindset using NLP tools from a certified NLP training to create the kind of success one wants. All it takes is put to action, the learning from your NLP training to achieve what you desire.</p>\n<p>You must have heard about S-M-A-R-T goals. Set SMART goals for yourself, condition your mind to achieve it and see the results. Something about SMART goals to get you started.</p>\n<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">S- Specific; M- Measurable; A- Achieved; R- Reasonable; T- Time</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specific</span></strong> – If you set a goal, be very specific about what your goal is.</p>\n<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Measurable</span></strong> – Goals have to be measurable. What can be measured can be achieved.</p>\n<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Achievable</span></strong> – State your goal in the present or past tense as if you have already achieved it.</p>\n<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reasonable</span></strong> – You cannot ask for the moon and find it in your drawing room. Your goal should be reasonable enough that you can attain it. You can think big but reasonable. Stretch yourself.</p>\n<p> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Time</span></strong> – Deadline. Have one. Have a specific date on when your goal will<br/> be achieved.</p>\n<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One more tool in the process of conditioning one’s mind is Visualization –</span></strong> Visualize your goal putting your emotions into it. Close your eyes and visualize how you feel after achieving the goal, what you would do, how you would celebrate, how it will affect your life and so on.</p>\n<p>Visualize you goal often. The more you visualize the more you will work harder to achieve it. Then bring to your mind that you will do whatever it takes to achieve it. Work hard and with such a passion that your goal becomes an achievement soon. Practice these techniques and you will find that when the desire is there, your subconscious mind will help you get it!</p>\n<p>Take control of your lives. Possess the willpower, self-discipline and emotional intelligence to design a life you will be proud of.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

Is it a new concept, which took birth not so long ago? Why would one need a coach? Why cannot a person live life as it comes along? Let’s understand how as a coach, we are given an opportunity to make a positive change in another person’s life, thus making the world a much better place to live in. </span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">I was reading an article about coaching and its benefits. Let me sum up the article in a short para.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">A coach helps a person make MORE sense of sense, to lead a better life, to run a better business or profession, in a more prosperous and satisfying manner, and I don’t just mean money and success. There is also peace, a higher sense of attainment, prosperity and the knowledge of how to deal with whatever comes our way, in the right manner.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">Having said this, let us go back to the rest of the questions I started this blog with. Is it a new concept? No. If you look back, coaches were always present, since centuries, in the form of sages, gurus, prophets, philosophers, guides, advisors, and so on. These personalities were coaches in some form or the other who would guide rulers, and eminent personalities who went on to do great things on this planet. They were the guiding light who lead these personalities to shine and succeed in life.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">As time went by, and with a lot more awareness that education and demands the current business scenario brought with it, coaching got a lot more structured. Results was the key word, that one looked for – in both business and as individuals. Coaches nowadays, are trained to conduct workshops and use tools that are much more effective in getting the desired results at a faster pace than before. </span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">Coaches coach human beings + human beings build satisfying businesses and satisfying lives = success in life, success at work, organisational success. </span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">Human beings are born with different personalities. Nature has made it so. With these personalities come different behaviours, likes, dislikes, mannerisms, and so on. We collectively don’t follow a typical pattern in anything we do. To add to it, our mannerisms, understanding, likes, dislikes, all change with age and phases of life we are in. That is why we are called human beings, not robots programmed to behave in a specific manner. Human beings are not similar in their success quotient too. Be it in any area of their lives. Some excel, some don’t. Some adapt, some don’t. Some learn, some don’t. And there are some who are neither here nor there. Some just don’t have the potential. Really? Is it true?</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">It definitely isn’t! Every human being is born with certain strengths. These strength or potential, can be nurtured in the right manner to make that being, successful. Human beings can be moulded in a certain manner to achieve success. But for this to happen, we need the right helping hand. If we do some research, we will see many successful personalities at some point or other, but majorly at a crucial phase in life, have found a helping hand, a pusher, a guide – A COACH, who created a way, a path to make them successful, to reach their potential and succeed. </span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">So what does a COACH do? Or, what would YOU do as a Coach?</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">THIS IS POWERFUL – You would do some interesting things with our lives. You would make sense of our so called sensible lives.

Simply put, building a great rapport with clients. Who doesn’t want sales! To a large extent, the business thrives, only when sales thrive.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">Your sales force is the m</span><span style="font-size: medium;">a</span><span style="font-size: medium;">inst</span><span style="font-size: medium;">a</span><span style="font-size: medium;">y for your business growth. They are the revenue churning machines, which then enables various other developments within the organisation.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">A well-known quote aptly says, </span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>“It takes months to find a customer and only seconds to lose one”.</b></span><span style="font-size: medium;"> How true. The underlined message here is, as a business we don’t want to lose even a single customer, do we?</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">How do we ensure we build rapport with customers – old and new?</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">Whilst talking to a colleague of mine, I simply posed the question: Give me one example of great rapport building and one of poor rapport building that you have experienced. She gave me an example of each, which looked apt to mention here, and are great examples. You will see what I mean.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Great rapport building</b></span><span style="font-size: medium;">: Our Company had a particular portal requirement. I spoke to a Marketing and Sales Representative by the name of Pratap, who understood our niche need. It was not an ‘on the shelf’ requirement, but he listened to us patiently and agreed to do his best to help us. Ideally I would not expect the person to get back so quickly considering the difficulty, but Pratap’s approach changed my perception. He spoke to his team and together they came up with a package that was not only cost effective but suited our requirement to the ‘t’. He also ensured we got sufficient training to use the product. There were follow ups to see that we liked the product. Moral: Our Company decided that we would be buying additional services from them in future too. Great rapport building ensuring return clientele and references.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Poor rapport building: </b></span><span style="font-size: medium;">My colleague wanted to hire laptops and contacted a relevant agency’s sales team. The concerned sales person, attended the call, took down the details and ensured he would get back with the required quote. A couple of days went by, but no call, no quote. After repeated follow-ups, a quote was sent without any scope for negotiation. Frustrated, she gave it up and contacted another service provider. Moral: The Company lost business and ‘word or mouth’ publicity.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">Building rapport doesn’t come easy. The sales person has to work towards achieving it. Once the lead is generated or a lead calls with a certain requirement, the sales person will need to do some research on the prospect and the prospect’s requirement. Rapport building is a process in itself and requires an amount or pre-planning. Before meeting the client, it would be advisable to prepare some useful questions and observations. Checking the client’s website, or social sites, if any, would also be a great idea. It would help knowing a little about your client’s business. It could give you headway during the initial meet or the negotiation process.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Some aspects we have to keep in mind while building rapport:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p align="justify"><b>Don’t fake it –</b>Your enthusiasm, knowledge and passion must be genuine. Today’s customer is well-informed. Authenticity and transparency is what will help in closing sales and is much appreciated by customers. Honesty helps a lot in rapport building with prospects and customers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p align="justify"><b>Positive attitude –</b> It is not necessary to adopt any accent or tone. You will be more at ease and confident when you use what is yours. Just add a genuine smile and friendly voice. Approach your prospect with a positive attitude, a firm handshake and make eye contact. Half your work is done when your approach is confident.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p align="justify"><b>Be a good listener – </b>Listening well to what your customer asks or talks will make them feel valued. Do not be self-focussed. Genuinely appear interested when they talk. The more they share with you the closer you are to making a sale. If not a sale, then you will definitely gather goodwill for your company or brand.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p align="justify"><b>Laying your heart out on a plate – </b>Don’t seem too needy. It puts most people off. People don’t like to be pushed. Follow-up, but only to the extent that it does not seem too conspicuous. You cannot force rapport. Being over-friendly is a no-no. Show interest, not desperation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p align="justify"><b>Know your client –</b> As indicated earlier, research your client, their products and services and their requirements before the meeting, so you go well prepared and pose the right questions. Don’t spend too much time chatting, get your point across at the right moment. Nobody likes their time wasted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p align="justify"><b>Using POWER WORDS –</b> Language plays a huge role in sales and marketing. Matching language patterns, using similar words as the client, to describe various aspects in the conversation creates a positive impact and increases rapport. The person feels understood and connected with you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p align="justify"><b>Create TRUST and UNDERSTANDING –</b>Most important is creating trust that you will give them a good product. Being sensitive to what the client wants; develop the ability to see the client’s point of view and get them to understand yours.Above all, be consistent in what you say.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">Successful interactions to establish a great rapport is possible when you understand your own mind and the minds of people you interact with. Neuro-lingustic Programming or NLP has the potential to help your sales force establish and maintain rapport by upping the human connect. People are more likely to buy from someone they can relate to, rather than someone they are not comfortable with. NLP uses techniques that are quite subtle but powerful in its usage, with measured effects. A great relationship building tool, NLP believes in the power of agreement by emphasizing on similarities, in-spite of all the differences two people can bring. Being with the other person in his space; focussing on ‘what we have in common’ and establishing rapport. Agreement gives birth to great rapport building and cooperation.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>If you emphasize the differences, you will find it hard to establish rapport. By emphasizing commonalities, resistance and antagonism will generally disappear, and cooperation will improve.” ………NLP mentor</i></span></p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

No. Definitely not! It takes patience and consistent efforts. Above all, one must have set goals, and to achieve these goals, one must keep learning and sharpening one’s skills.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Here’s a story.

What is important here is to believe the goal is achievable. It requires us to have a positive mind-set and to take that first step towards this achievement. </span><span style="font-size: medium;">A mind-set that allows us to be happy, to enjoy every moment of our journey. A mind-set that draws success towards us.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">We all have amazing potential within us. What is important is we push the right buttons to activate it. Our self-imposed limitations and mental blocks will actively prevent us from achieving our goals.</span><span style="font-size: medium;">The best way to start is from within. To understand ourselves, our minds. What our strengths and weaknesses are? What are the threats we face – internally and externally, because of the so called “make-up” that we have worked so hard to wear. It needs to come off – that is the first step.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;"><u><b>How do we shape and sustain a positive mind-set – few effective lines to start with.</b></u></span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">1. Remember to be thankful for what we have instead of crying and worrying for what we don’t. It changes our perspective and opens doors for a positive change to happen. </span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">2. Stop whinging and whining till you get your toy. We need to grow up. Think of the bigger picture, the end goal. Let’s have the ability and disposition to accept that everything will not go our way. We can decide how we behave when things don’t go our way. No one said that the road to success is easy. But worth sticking there, I tell you.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">3. Re-design expectations – nobody owes us anything. Expectations should be internal, from ourselves. We must re-evaluate ourselves. Set expectations and work towards achieving it. One can ask for help, for support, but remember, we are not entitled to receive it. This thought is empowering.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">4. Watch for the devil within – he will poke us and get us into a negative thinking state. These negative thinking loops creep in time and again and will be the biggest roadblock – beware and be aware. Have the ability and strength to bring thoughts and actions back into the positive frame. Talking to some good friend or taking a short break or spending time in a positive environment will help shoo away these blues. </span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">5. Plan your day in advance and set up a routine: The path to success requires having consistent habits. Routine is often considered boring but plays a huge role in inviting success. We are creatures of habit, and what we do daily, we become excellent at it. </span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">8. Keep sharpening the saw – remember the story! Stagnancy only leads to defeat. Keep moving and up-skilling. Remember – change is the only constant. One must always be geared to meet the change.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">An active tool that can help us understand ourselves literally, is Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), a remarkable psychological technique that will guide us to make small internal changes in our minds, in order to bring a huge transformation to the rest of our lives.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">This interactive technique opens windows to help us understand how our mind works, how to alter our perceptions and feelings, and how to change our emotions quickly and easily, with confidence and purpose. NLP is not just another training or learning. It’s application. We apply these learning as we learn. “NLP is the DNA of Applied Psychology”, says Anita Kozlowski, “With true NLP training you will discover and maximize your potential, both personally and professionally. You will become much more effective and efficient, more confident and resourceful, and more powerful in all interpersonal situations.”</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">Learning this technique is the best investment one can make. “You will never be in a reactive mode again,” says Anita Kozlowski. One can take control of one’s life.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>So what are we waiting for! Take those baby steps, pick up speed, break all barriers and achieve your goal.</b></span></p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

    htmlData:
      '<div class="entry-header">\n<div class="entry-thumbnail-area">\n<img src="/blog-hd/blog-img4-1200x600.jpeg"/></div>\n<!--<div class="entry-content">\t\t\t-->\n<!-- -->\n<!--\t\t<div class="entry-meta">-->\n<!--\t\t\t<ul>-->\n<!-- -->\n<!--\t\t\t\t\t<li><i class="fa fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></i>January 24, 2019</li>-->\n<!-- -->\n<!--\t\t\t</ul>-->\n<!--\t\t</div>-->\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">Sounds interesting, doesn’t it? What does this refer to? The meaning is quite simple. Behaviour modification means conditioning one’s behaviour to reap positive attitudes. In simple words, it means, exchanging undesirable behaviours for more suitable ones, using various techniques and processes. These modification techniques could be used to change different behaviours, simple or complex doesn’t matter. It could be just as simple as wanting to wake up early in the morning or to stop procrastinating to more restrictive behaviours like stopping an alcohol or smoking addiction. It’s all about understanding wrong behaviour and making it right, to be successful and content. </span></p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">These undesirable behaviours could affect both, our personal as well as professional lives. For example, if you are a person who always procrastinates, how can you ever complete any given work on time? Or say, you get angry for every small reason, how can you succeed in relationship management? So many such areas, big and small, for behaviour modification techniques to be adopted in order to make our lives better and purposeful.</span></p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;"><u><b>What is Behaviour Modification?</b></u></span></p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">B. F. Skinner, an American psychologist, behaviourist, author, inventor, and social philosopher, came up with the theory of Behaviour Modification. In his theory, he has considered free will an illusion, and states that, human action is dependent on consequences of previous actions. If the consequences are bad, there is a high chance the action will not be repeated; if the consequences are good, the actions that led to it being repeated become more probable. Skinner called this the Principle of Reinforcement. Skinner’s theory of behavioural modification seeks to change or shape behaviour through a set of stimuli and response actions. But you have to be first aware that there is a problem or identify those behaviours you want to change.</span></p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">In a Behaviour Modification process, various techniques are used to try and change a particular type of behaviour. If we look carefully, this process takes place in our everyday lives too. Have you been scolded or punished by your parents/teachers when you were a child for some wrong behaviour? And maybe, you are doing it with your children too. Parents and teachers have been using various techniques to change children’s undesirable behaviour patterns into desirable ones, since centuries. Using these techniques, they teach children to understand right from wrong. Many of these techniques are used by Therapists, Trainers, and so on, to achieve desirable behaviour patterns.</span></p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;"><u><b>How does the process work?</b></u></span></p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">Since the desirable outcome of behaviour modification is replacing negative or undesirable behaviour with positive or desirable behaviour, a set or system of positive and negative consequences for an unwanted behaviour is introduced. An individual thus learns the correct set of responses for any given stimulus which can also be called altered behaviour. Behavioural Trainers have been using such techniques to garner wanted reactions and behaviours from employees. Application of these techniques have come as a boon to many working professionals and organisations, helping in sustained growth and success for them. </span>&lt;/</p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">This process is so strong, that use of these techniques in treating disorders like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, phobias, separation anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder, disruptive behaviour and autism, among other conditions, have been successful.</span></p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;"><u><b>Behaviour Modification Techniques </b></u></span></p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">Behaviours can be learned and unlearned, using certain techniques. This is the baseline of the Behaviour Modification process. With Training and People Development taking precedence in organisations today, Behaviour Modification plays a huge role in developing the right mind-set and building capability of human capital. Since the process relies hugely on the concept of conditioning, let us first understand the type of techniques or conditioning adopted in Behaviour Modification. </span></p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;"><u><b>There are two major types of conditioning; Classical Conditioning and Operant Conditioning.</b></u></span></p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Classical Conditioning</b></span>– involves learning a new behaviour by linking the process to some kind of association. This type of conditioning relies on a particular stimulus or signal which are linked together to produce a new learned response in a person or animal.</p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">Some classic examples of classic conditioning would be: 1) As we see in circuses, the ringmaster cracks his whip, which produces an instant reaction from the animal, and he will perform what act is required. 2) If a child is punished by putting him in a dark room, he will always be apprehensive of the dark. 3) If a student is ridiculed for wearing spectacles, he will dislike wearing spectacles, probably for the rest of his life or until his behaviour is conditioned into a more desirable one. All of these are reinforced by the conditioning they receive.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" lang="en-US"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Operant Conditioning:</b></span>This type of conditioning, if used positively, brings about the desired results, more effectively and consistently. This form of conditioning is based on the system of rewards and punishments. Animal trainers use this type of conditioning to get the desired and consistent performance from their animals. Since the results are measurable in this kind of conditioning, schools, colleges, institutions have been using this format to bring out the best in students. Corporates and business houses have been using this conditioning to achieve desirable results from employees.</p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">Operant Conditioning could be defined as a form of learning in which a response increases in frequency as a result of its being followed by reinforcement. For example, when a parrot is given a chilli as a reward if he speaks, he will do it again and again consistently, with a hope of getting the reward again.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">Another example is, if an employee is rewarded by his employer for the good work he has done, his performance will keep getting better and better. Or if a child is punished for bringing in bad marks by taking way his video game for a period of time. In this case, most of the time, the child will try to do better each time, in fear of losing his video game if he doesn’t. </span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;">To put it simply, </span><span style="font-size: medium;">in Operant Conditioning, there is a response that is followed by a reinforcing stimulus, and which is likely to occur again and again</span><span style="font-size: medium;">.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Some Reinforcements one can adopt.</b></span></p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>1. Positive Reinforcements</b></span> – Human beings and animals respond positively to praise and recognition. Providing Positive Reinforcements involves providing a ‘reward’ experience when someone does something desirable. This conditioning can be done on self too. For example, if you are trying to wake up early and have been doing so consistently for a week, treat yourself to a movie during the weekend, as a reward.</p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>2. Negative Reinforcements</b></span> – The child and video game example given above. Negative reinforcement involves a form of punishment for undesirable behaviour with an intent to change it into desirable behaviour or face the consequences. The result of this conditioning is, the action is not repeated or is minimised due to fear of having to face an adverse reaction. This kind of reinforcement works well with adults too.&gt;</p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>3. Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) –</b></span></p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">The NLP technique is a study of communication; with the conscious and unconscious mind. In this technique, behaviour is altered using various tools and techniques like submodalities, metaprograms, and so on. This is a powerful tool to reinforce desirable behaviours and works on a person’s subconscious to consciously enable a positive change.</span></p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>4. Meditation</b></span></p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">A very effective practice to induce behaviour changes. Meditation improves brain function, memory and focus. It enables the left brain portion to interact and be in focus with the right brain hemisphere. Meditation alleviates anxiety and depression, thus helping an individual to become more focused which enables better decision making and consistency. Both the brain and body are in tandem which enables a spirit of well-being.</span></p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>5. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</b></span> – is a short-term psychotherapy treatment that takes a hands-on, practical approach to problem-solving. In this therapy, the root cause behind people’s difficulties are analysed. CBT’s goal is to change patterns of thinking or behaviour behind these root causes and change the way people feel about them. CBT is used to help treat a wide range of issues in a person’s life, from sleeping difficulties or relationship problems, to drug and alcohol abuse or anxiety and depression.</p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>6. Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT).</b></span> This is a revolutionary technique and is also known as Meridian Tapping. Breaking all the conventional rules of Psychology, EFT contends that the cause of all negative emotions is a disruption in the body’s energy system. Negative or undesirable behaviour also termed as short circuits occurs when there is a shift in the body’s energy system. To bring it to a healthy balance, drumming is carried out on certain areas of the body, which help release these short circuits, to bring about the desired results.</p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>7. Ignoring</b></span> – Effective most of the time, an unwanted behaviour can be modified through ignoring the act. For example – if a person has a tendency to irritate or be disruptive, by ignoring him or his behaviour, there is a probability that you will reduce its tendency for appearing again. People generally don’t like being ignored. When you do so, the message is read loud and clear and the person stops the undesirable behaviour.</p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>What are the steps in a Behaviour Modification Process? </b></span></p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>One has to first</b></span></p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>After which, one can:</b></span></p>\n<p align="justify"></p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">Behaviour Modification is a powerful tool to change any unwanted behaviours into more positive and productive ones. So powerful that it can be used to treat any kind of behavioural, stress related or mental issues successfully. </span></p>\n<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">Want to change some undesirable behaviour into more positive ones. Just do it.</span></p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

I was waiting at a Café, sipping hot coffee, indulging in my favourite pastime, whilst waiting for my friends to join me. I noticed two friends having a conversation about their life goals. One of them was sharing how the appraisals this time was not favourable for him and about wanting to quit his job. As the conversation progressed, he started discussing about the problems going on in his life and how his life has turned into a complete mess…… Boy! This guy had serious issues.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">I turned to look at the other guy who was calmly listening to him. It looked to me that he was some kind of a Life Therapist or maybe a Life Coach. There was some interaction and charting going on out there. Leaving them to their interaction, I slowly took my thoughts to a time, when I was in a similar position, roughly two years ago. At the crossroads of my profession, not knowing what to do, my professional, and personal life needed some serious introspection and alterations. I was lucky that my well-wishers suggested I seriously consider having a Life Coach. Well, here,</span><span style="font-size: medium;">I won’t share how opting for a Life Coach changed the course of my life. But, I definitely will write about the importance of having a Life Coach and the difference it would make, to have someone guide us, through difficult phases of our lives, especially in our professional decisions, business decisions. </span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">There are two types of interactions one can have with coaching. The first is:</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;"><u><b>One-to-one Coaching.</b></u></span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">We all need that extra push to do things we are likely to procrastinate about, and never get done. But which is important for our success. This could most often be, due to the mind-set we have developed as human beings to always put away things for tomorrow or afterwards, especially where mammoth tasks or decisions are concerned. Having a coach will help us get into the mind set of understanding the importance of being in the present, of being in the ‘NOW’. A coach can help us, to not only write down our goals, but to also get into the right mind-set and will suggest the right way to achieve it in a timely manner.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">The Second is:</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;"><u><b>Group Coaching</b></u></span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">This type of coaching is extremely beneficial for organisations, since it is time and cost effective and brings in the desired results. This type of coaching, basically focuses on goal setting, time management, action, accountability and awareness around key issues. Group coaching taps on the collective wisdom of the group and fosters collective insights to various learnings and solutions.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: large;"><u><b>I am Stuck? It’s bothering me? How can a Coach help me?</b></u></span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">Coaching is a guidance process in itself. The coaching process creates an environment, where you will know and understand yourself, and the world, in order to make informed decisions pertaining to your life or your career. Coaching targets on specific areas to ensure optimum results especially in the areas of what motivates you, tapping on your interests, personality traits and skill set. It is a choice that will make your life more meaningful, fulfilling and rewarding. As truly quoted,</span><i><b> </b></i><span style="font-size: medium;"><i><b>“Coaching is unlocking a person’s potential to maximise their own performance. It’s more often about helping them to learn rather than teaching them.” – John Whitmore</b></i></span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">Unfortunately not everyone takes up coaching when required. Maybe due to the cost or some other reasons. That is why, so many people end up taking jobs that are not of their liking, leaving them bored, dissatisfied and unhappy, throughout their lives. This is where the requirement of a coach is utmost required. </span><span style="font-size: medium;">Organisations must understand the importance of having willingly engaged personnel, as only they will share the vision you have for your organisation and work towards achieving it. This engagement will happen only when the organisation works towards bringing about the professional fulfilment the employee is looking for, in terms of career and growth. What better way than to engage a coach? Let’s look at all the possibilities and benefits coaching would bring into an organisation.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Coaching: An Important Aspect of Leadership</b></span></p>\n\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">Where leadership roles are concerned, it is even more important, in fact mandatory, to have a knowledgeable person, guide you through various stages in the process, so that the end benefit would be person and organisational fulfilment. </span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">As you progress in your career and begin to transition into leadership roles, one thing becomes crystal clear, it’s no more about you. It’s about the performance of your team, and the overall organizational efficiency to be achieved.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">In today’s competitive era and highly volatile markets, coaching plays a vital role in appreciating the right talents which greatly contributes in organization’s growth and prosperity. Especially in the leadership bracket. Senior Managers and Executives feel much valued, when organizations offer them the opportunity of getting coached, where they can speak about their problems, get feedback and suggestions about achieving critical results which will enable them to stay at the top. Coaching offers results that are measurable and significant, both in quantity and quality, which in turn maximises ROI.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">Another key component of good coaching is identifying talents and hidden potential in team members, and properly leveraging them for the growth of the company and the member’s career.  Finding and developing the right talent, is one of the most important jobs a leader takes on as the future of the organization depends on it. Coaching can help the Senior Managers and Executives achieve this.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Measurable benefits of Coaching in Leadership:</b></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify core strengths and areas of growth</li>\n<li>Identify areas of improvement and behaviours so one can work to change them</li>\n<li>Identify personal issues and problems that could act as a barrier, impacting work life</li>\n<li>Helps in finding the root cause of problems and removing them once and for all</li>\n<li>Help make most out of knowledge, skills, expertise and experience</li>\n<li>Helps make life healthier, happier and stress-free</li>\n<li>Builds positive people</li>\n<li>Return on Investment</li>\n</ul>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: large;"><i>A good coach will make people see what they can be, rather than what they are.</i></span></p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',

We can choose to use this force constructively with words of encouragement, or destructively using words of despair. Words have energy and power with the ability to help, to heal, to hinder, to hurt, to harm, to humiliate and to humble……….. Yehuda Berg</b></i></span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">Powerful, isn’t it? But true. Consciously or sub-consciously, words, to be more specific ‘trigger words’ have the power to influence decisions, make people see things the way you want them to, to induce actions and reactions. This is the </span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Hypnotic Power of Words.</b></span></p>\n\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">You don’t believe this can actually happen, do you? Let me tell you, this is serious stuff, because time and again we’ve all been hypnotized to accept certain trigger words, subtly of course. Right from birth! </span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">The use of words in a conversation, designed to induce some kind of reaction or action is called conversational hypnosis. </span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">Before understanding this ‘phenomena’ further, let us take a look at what using ‘trigger words’ in a conversation can make us do.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">These trigger words are capable of:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Painting a certain picture in our minds related to the words</li>\n<li>Stimulates our imagination</li>\n<li>Has the power to distract us</li>\n<li>Bring relationships closer</li>\n<li>Close deals</li>\n<li>Create friendships and associations</li>\n<li>Activates our senses</li>\n<li>Helps us co-relate certain things which we otherwise would have missed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And much more</p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">During conversations or while reading a book or an article, you’ve probably heard of the expression “when pig’s fly”. What do you relate it with? Our brain quickly registers this expression as ‘something that will never happen’, isn’t it? Have you ever seen a pig fly?</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">If you are a manager of some department, your boss could one day come up to you and say, “Hello Jim, our company is running losses. </span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Cut corners</b></span><span style="font-size: medium;"> wherever possible.” Your brain immediately registers that – cut corners would be, to do something in the easiest, quickest, or cheapest way, often harming the quality of your work. </span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">There are so many such examples of conversational hypnosis were words are used to trigger some expected action. Another powerful word is the word ‘remember’. Just saying this word, not only stimulates our imagination, but it enables us to forms a picture in our head which helps us relive the moment. ‘Remember the time, we……..’</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">These words are simple, widely used, everyday words, but, when used in the correct manner it can be powerfully persuasive. </span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">One of the most powerful abilities you will ever be able to possess is the knowledge and skills to be able to persuade a person. Whether you are in a Leadership position, in Sales and Marketing, in Training or in an everyday scenario where you want to get the kind of reaction you are looking for. Possessing this skill will always see you one up the ladder with satisfactory outcomes. </span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;"><u><b>Conversational Hypnosis – The best form of Persuasion</b></u></span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">What if you can possess the ability to influence anyone, yet your conversation appears to be like not really influencing them?</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">Just imagine possessing such an ability, especially in your professional scenario. None of your deals would get cancelled. You and your team could close deals like a piece of cake. You just have to learn the techniques to connect and communicate with people at a deeper level which will help you become more persuasive.</span><b> </b></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Note: </b></span><span style="font-size: medium;">You could be missing out on having amazing conversations, just because you don’t yet know Conversational Hypnosis.<span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Imagine how much you would be losing out on.</b></span></span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>What is Conversational or Covert Hypnosis?</b></span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">Conversational hypnosis mean a communication conducted in a different way or method. The purpose is to unlock the ability to persuade people, and get them to do what you want them to do.</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">This science or process forms a part of NLP – Neuro-Linguistic Programming and mainly focuses on developing an appropriate kind of communication and behavioural pattern in order to achieve desired results, keeping your end goal in mind, which would be, to persuade and garner action from your listeners, by communicating and influencing their unconscious minds. The beauty of this science is that, since the unconscious mind of the listener is not even aware that a message is being relayed, you will get minimal resistance.</span><b> </b></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">Knowing Conversational Hypnosis could prove to be a boon for every individual especially professionals in Sales and Marketing, Business Development, Team Leaders, Entrepreneurs, people at managerial positions, and so on. Knowing what to say to your clients that will make the deepest impact. It’s possible!</span></p>\n<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-IN"><span style="font-size: medium;">Conversational Hypnosis use power loops and embedded commands in conversations. This engaging and persuasive form of communication gets results much faster by creating instant rapport with your listener and ultimately getting them support your idea or buy your product. Powerful isn’t it. What more could a business ask for, then better returns and goodwill? And what better way to do this then for them to enable themselves and their workforce with the power to persuade.</span></p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>\n\n</div>',
